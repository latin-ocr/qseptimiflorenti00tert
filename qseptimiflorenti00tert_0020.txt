gists than Le Nourry (whose Apparatus, Par. 1715, is reprinted
in Migne and in Oehler) and Christian Kortholt (15 Jan.
mag—31 March 1694), whose ‘Paganus obtrectator' (Kiel
1698 4to, 2nd ed. Lubeck 1703 4to), comment. on Iust. M.,
Athenag, Theophil, Tatian (ibid. 1675 101. ‘profundae erudi-
tionis,’ says Walch); ‘de persecutionibus ecclesiae primaeuae'
(Kiel 1689 4to) and other works (see the Bodleian catalogue
and J oecher) are in my judgement still necessary to the student.
If Mr Carstens, in a slight article in the Allg. deutsche Bio-
graphie XVI (Leipz. 1882) 7 26 says that K.'s books “have been
long overtaken by the advance 01 80101100 and have no longer
any importance,’' I comfort myself by the remembrance that
11118 Biography is weakest in the lives and works 01 801101318.
Ι should like to cross—examine Mr Carstens on Kortholt.
Of works on the other apologists that 01 Semisch 011 Justin
and Keim‘s Celsus, 310, 80 far as I know, the most helpful.
Beside printed sources, my ideal editor should inquire 101
manuscriptsl. My mouth watered when I read Blunt’s 0381131

1 [May I again call attention to the fact that there is a tenth-century MS
of chapters 38, 39 and part 01 40 01 the Apoloyeticus in the Kantons-Bibliothek

at Ziirich (Rheinau XCV), which is closely related to the lost Fulda MS (Journal
of Theoloqical Studies, VIII (moe—1907), pp. 297—300)? This fact has been
overlooked by Rauschen and others. Also, why has it been left to me to point
out that the MS containing “Tertulliani Quaedam,'’ alluded to by Oehler,
vol. 1, p. xxi, after Montfaucon Bibl. bibl. tom. 1, p. 1134, as in the catalogue
01 the library of St Germain-des-Pres, and doubtless identical with the MS of
the Apoloqeticus at Petrograd, also alluded to by Oehler (p. xii), 18 still as a
matter of fact at Petrograd (Q. v. l, No. 40), having been brought there by
Peter Dubrowsky? It is of the ninth century, is probably the oldest existing
MS of the Apoloqeticus, and is mentioned in K. Gillert’s catalogue, printed in
the Neues Archiv, v (1880), 241—265‚ 597-617, vr (1881), 497—512‚ and
described (with a photograph 01 one page) in A. Staerk, Les Manu-serit& Latius
(lu Ve aa XI I I 6 siecle consen-63 ὰ la Bibliotheque I mpe'riac'e de Saint-Pe‘tersbourq
<2 tomes, St Petersbourg, 1910), Tome ῑ, p. 130, Tome 11, planche 57. Further,
Kroymann, the new Vienna editor 01 Tertullian, is entirely ignorant of the
Luxemburg MS 01 Tertullian, no. 75 (saec. xv ex), though it appears to have
been used by Semler, and a catalogue 01 the Luizemburg collection was published
in 1894. The MS contains carn. Chr„ carn. resurr„ cor. mil„ mart„ paenit„
uirg. 110]., hab. mul.‚ cult. 10111, 3(1 ux. 1 and Π, (10 fug. in pers„ Scap„ exh.
cast„ monogss, pall„ pat. Dei (sic), adu. Prax.‚ adu. Val.‚ adu. Marc„ adu. Iud„
adu. omn. haer., praescr. her., adu. Hermog. The contents thus bear a striking
resemblance to those of certain Italian MSS, e.g.Vat.Urb.64 (saec. xv), described
by Kroymann in the first article mentioned on p. xi, pp. 4, 5. A. S.]
