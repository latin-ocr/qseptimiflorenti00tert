APOLOGETIOVS 50 147

endurance of pain and death, as Cicero in the Tusculans, Seneca
in his book on chauces, Diogenes, Pyrrho and Callinicus. But
yet words do not find so many disciples as the Christians do by
their teaching by deeds. That very obstinacy, with which you
upbraid us, is a lesson. For who is there that is not stirred up
by the consideration of it to ask what there is within it? Who
does not join us when he has asked? who when he has joined
us, does not eagerly desire to suffer, that he may buy back the
whole favour of God, that he may procure all indulgence from
him by the payment of his own blood? For all sins are forgiven
to this action. Hence it is that in the sanie place we give
thanks to your judgments. As there is an enmity between what
is of God and what is of man, when we are condemned by you,
we are acquitted by God.
