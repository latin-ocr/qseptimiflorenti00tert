be made, as a complaint 01 0116 sort is balanced by the gain
coming from all other calculations.

CHAP. XLIII. I will readily 60111633 what sort 01 11601116 6611
perhaps truly complain 01 13116 unprofitableness 01 15116 Christians.
First will come the procurers, the pimps, the bullies, then the
assassins, the poisoners, the magicians; likewise the diviners,
the soothsayers‚ the astrologers. To be unprofitable to these
is great profit. And yet whatsoever loss there is to your
property through this sect, can be balanced by some protection
afforded by them. At what price do you value, Ι (10 not say„
those who have the power to drive out evil spirits 110111 you
now—I do not now say those who offer their prayers 101 you
also before the true God, because perhaps you do not believe
in Him, but those from whom you have nothing to sear?

CHAP. XLIV But indeed there is a loss to the state, as
great as it is real, to which no 0116 pays any regard, an injury
to the state 01 which 110 0116 takes account, when m our persons
so many just 111611 616 wasted, so many innocent men are
squandered away. For we now appeal to your records 01 pro-
ceedings, ye who daily preside over the trials 01 11113011613, who
by passing sentences erase the charges out 01 15116 calendar. So
many guilty persons are examined by you on various charges:
what assassin there, what cutpurse‚ what sacrilegious person
or debaucher 01 thies 01 the baths, is there among them who
is also described as a Christian? Or, when Christians are pro-
secuted on their specific charge (1.6. the charge 01 Christianity),
who among them is also such as so many criminals are? It
is with your own people that the prisons are always steaming,
your own people who make the mines re-echo to their sighs, the
wild beasts are always stuffed with the same, and 110111 among
them too the givers 01 shows always find herds 01 criminals to
feed. No one there is a Christian, unless he is nothing but a
Christian3 01, 11 116 be also anything 6136, 116 13 already no
longer a Christian.

CHAP. XLV. We alone therefore are 1166 from guilt. What
wonder, 11 it is inevitable? For indeed it is inevitable. Taught
innocence by God, we both know it perfectly, seeing it has been
revealed by a perfect teacher, and guard it faithfully, as com-
mitted to us by an observer who cannot be slighted. But to
you man' 3 judgment has handed down upfightness, man 3
tyranny‚ too, has commanded it: thence it is that you belong
to a discipline which is neither complete nor really to be feared
