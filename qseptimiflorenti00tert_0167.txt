mob through injustice, make a boast of it. As if all the power
you have over us were not of our own free choice! Surely it
is only if I will it to be so, that Ι am a Christian3 you will
therefore condemn me, only if Ι will to be condemned; since
the power you have over me, you do not possess unless I will
it, your power therefore belongs to my will, not to your own
authority. So also the mob vainly rejoices at the way in which
we are tormented; for in the same way the joy is ours, which
they claim for themselves, as we prefer to be condemned rather
than to fall away from God: while, on the contrary, those that
hate us ought to mourn, not to rejoice, because we have attained
that which we have chosen.

CHAP. L. ‘So,’ you say, ‘why do you complain that we
persecute you, if you wish to suffer, since you ought to love
those by whose means you suffer what you wish? ³ Certainly
we wish to suffer, but in the way in which a soldier also suffers
war. Nobody indeed willingly suffers, since both panic and
danger are inevitably to be faced, and yet the man who com-

that carries with it both the glory, of pleasing God, and the
spoil, which is eternal life. But, you will say, we are convicted,
yes, but it is after we have won the day; therefore we have
conquered, when we are killed. Thus we escape, when we are

because bound to a stake the length of half an axle we are
burned by the faggots surrounding us. This is the garb of our
victory, this our garment decked with palm-leaves, such is the
chariot in which we triumph. Naturally therefore we do not
please those whom we conquered; for that is the reason why
we are regarded as desperate and reckless men. But this despe-
ration and recklessness in your midst exalts the standard of
virtue in the cause of glory and renown. Mucius gladly left his
