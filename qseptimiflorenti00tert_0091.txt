both by prodigies and by portents‚ (all) are written (down) with
foresight. While we experience them, they are being read;
while we examine them, they are being proved true. The truth
of prophecy is, Ι think, a reliable evidence 01 divinity. There-

1010 113 15 thus that amongst us the belief also in future events ,

15 safe, being already 01 course proved true, because they were
prophesied along with those things that are daily verified; the
same words sound, the same letters mark them, the same spirit
impels them, time is an unity to prophecy when foretelling the
future. Among men perhaps it is marked 011 into periods,
while it is being completed, while the present is calculated from
the future, then the past from the present. What is our sin,
I pray you, in believing the future also, as we have already
learned through two stages to believe it?

CHAP. XXI. But since we have stated that this sect is
supported by most ancient J ewish documents, though very
many know on our own declaration also that it is comparatively
neW, belonging as it does to the time 01 Τ11)011115, perchance
on this ground a further inquiry may be made into its nature,
viz. that it conceals some 01 its own arrogance under the shadow
of a most famous religion, or one that is at any rate permitted
by law, or because in addition to the question of its age we have
no relation with the Jews either with regard to distinctions of
meats, or the sanctity of special days 01 the distinctive bodily

of course be our duty if we were the property of the same god.
Even the commonfpeople' now know Christ as a human being,
such as the Jews judged him (to be), so that it is easier for any
one to believe that we are worshippers of a man. But we are
neither ashamed of Christ, seeing that we rejoice to be reckoned
as his servants and condemned with him, nor is our idea of God
different from that of the Jews. We must therefore say some-
thing about Christ as God. The Jews had long enjoyed favour
with God, for among them the justice and loyalty 01 their
ancestors at the beginning were remarkable3 whence the
greatness 01 1311011 race and the glory 01 1311011 kingdom fiourished
and so great happiness, that from the words 01 God, by which
they were taught, they were warned beforehand as to the
gaining 01 1115 favour and the avoidance 01 1115 displeasure.
But how greatly they transgressed, being puffed up by con-
fidence in their fathers to leave the true path, and profanely
turning aside from their training! Even if they themselves did
not admit the fact, their ruinous situation to-day would prove
it. Scattered in all directions, straggling, exiles from their own
