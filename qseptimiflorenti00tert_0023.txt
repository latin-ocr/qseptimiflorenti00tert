centuries. Thus: Henri Goelzer, ‘Etude lexicographique' et
grammaticale de la Latinite de Saint J erome' (Paris, Hachette,
1884), and (a perfect model in its way) Max Bonnet‚ ‘Le Latin
de Gregoire de Tours' (ibid. 1890). The Archiv 1111 lat.
Lexikographie, published since 1884 by Teubner, has, thanks to
the sels-sacrifice 01 the publisher and the editor Ed. Wfflffiin, ’
done a great work in surveying the whole field 01 Latin letters,
and training readers to gather in the whole mass 01 Latin words.
There too may be seen reviews 01 311 new books and articles
bearing on the subject.

There is yet an opening 101· two lexicons, 01 moderate
compass, but 01 great value to critics, lexicographers and
grammarians.

(A) We possess two lexicons 01 terminations in Greek, but,
to my knowledge, none in Latin. [The want was supplied in
1904 by O. GradenwitZ, Later uli Vocum Latinarum: Voces
Latinas et 3 11011130 013 3 tergo ordinandas curauit (Leipzig). A. S.]

dictionarium analogicum linguae graecae' (Cambr. typis acad.
1800. 4to), a book recommended by the late Dr Thompsong
and (ΙΙ) ‘Etymologisches Worterbuch der griechischen Sprache
zur Uebersicht der Wortbildung 113011 den Endsylben geOrdnet
von Dr Wilhelm Pape’ (Berl. 1836, 8vo).

(B) Faber and Gesner frequently record under one word
other words with which it is liable to be confounded by scribes3
they also cite lexicographical collections in commentaries and
journals. Whoever has traced with attention the course 01

, lexicography knows that almost every word well treated by any

lexicon owes its good fortune to some exhaustive note 01 N.
Heins, or J. F. GronOV, or Bentley cet. The indexes to such
books as Drakenborch’s Livy and Duker’s Florus will shew how
the thing should be done. To go down the whole course 01
classical learning, 110111 such treasuries as Gruter’s ‘Fax
Artium,’ to the ‘aduersaria’ 01 Madvig and the ‘lectiones' 01
Cobet, would be the making 01 any young scholar.

The most useful commentary, on the whole, is Oehler⁷s.
Herauld also and Rigault should be read, and Dr Pusey. La
Cerda is copious in parallels. Pamelius takes 3 polemical
