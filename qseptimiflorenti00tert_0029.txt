01 hatred be defended, seeing that it is tor be tested not by the
verdict passed but by a good conscience? When therefore men
hate because they do not know the character 01 what they hate,
what is to hinder the thing hated 110111 being 01 the sort they
ought not to hate? So we refute either position 110111 the other,
showing that in hating they do not knOW, and that in not
knowing, their hatred is unjust. It is an evidence 01 the
ignorance, which, while it is made the excuse, is really the
condemnation 01 injustice, when all who hated in the past,
because they did not know the character 01 that which they
hated, cease to hate as soon as they cease to be ignorant. It
is from this class that Christians are produced, 01 course from
conviction, and begin to hate what they had been, and to pro-
fess what they hated, and are indeed as numerous as we who
are branded with that name. They cry aloud that the state
is besieged: that (even) in the country-districts, in the (walled)
villages, in the islands, you will find Christians. They mourn
as 101 3 loss that all, without distinction 01 sex, age, circumstances,
or even position, are deserting to this name. And yet even in
this very way they do not carry on their minds to the appraise-
ment 01 some good hidden therein3 they do not care1 to 101111
3 truer conjecture upon a closer inqfflry, they have no pleasure
in trying it at closer quarters. In this sphere alone is human
curiosity apathetic; they delight to be ignorant, while others
rejoice to have learned. How much more severely would
Anacharsis have condemned these men, as specimens 01 the
unwise judging the wise, than as the unmusical judging the
musical! They had rather be ignorant, because they already
hate; such a strong suspicion have they that what they are
ignorant of is that which, 11 they knew it, they could not hate;
since, 11 110 duty to hate were discovered, it would 01 course be
best to cease to hate unjustly, but 11 there were no doubt as to
desert, not only would there be no withdrawal 01 hatred, but
persistence would gain greater force, even through the sanction
01 justice itself. ⁶ But it is not therefore good,’ they say, ‘ because
it makes many converts: 101 how many are fashioned for evil!
how many deserters are there to what is wrong? ’ Who denies
it? Yet what is truly evil, even those who are in its clutches
do not dare to defend as good. Nature has stamped on every
evil thing the character either 01 1031 01 01 shame. Accordingly
evil-doers are eager to hide, they shrink from showing themselves,
they tremble when caught, deny their guilt when charged, and
even when tortured do not readily or always confess. To
