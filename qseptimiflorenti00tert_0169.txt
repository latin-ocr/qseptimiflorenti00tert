a brave man, what a conqueror even in captivityl' Anax-

pestle, kept saying: ‘Pound, pound away: for it is the bodily

actually joke about such a death as his! I leave out
those who bargained 101 131116 with their 011 11 swords or some
other milder 101111 01 death. For, 10, 617611 1117311168 01 tortures
are crowned by you. An Athenian harlot who had already
11 earied out the executioner, at last bit through her tongue and
spat it out into the face 01 the cruel tyrant, that she might
spit out 1161 own voice 3180, 10 prevent her from being able 10

give in and desire 10 do so. Zeno of Elea, being consulted by
Dionysius as 10 what was the benefit 01 philosophy, when he
had replied: ‘Contempt 01 death,’ without showing feeling he
was thereupon exposed to the scourges of the tyrant and con-
tinued to seal his opinion even up to the point 01 death.
Assuredly the scourges 01 1116 Spartans, embittered, as they
were, under the eyes even 01 cheering relatives, confer upon
the family a reputation 101 endurance, in proportion to the
blood they have shed. Here is a glory licensed because human,
to which neither reckless prejudice nor desperate persuasion
is ascribed in despising death and every sort 01 cruelty, to
which it is allowed to endure more 101 one's city, 101 1116
empire, and 101 friendship, than it is allowed to endure 101
God! And yet 101 311 111686 you cast statues and write inscrip-
tions and engrave titles to last 101· 61761; certainly you your-
selves also, in so 131 38 you can, in a certain sense confer resurrec-

hopes 101 3 real resurrection 110111 God, if he suffer 101 God, is
thought insane. But go on thus, ye excellent governors, and
you will be all the more popular with the mob 11 you sacrifice
Christians to their wishes: crucify, torture, condemn, annihilate
us: your injustice is a proof 01 0111 111110661166. It is 101 11131
reason that God allows us to suffer these things. For quite
recently by condemning a Christian woman to the lust 01 man
rather than to a lion, you confessed that the stain upon chastity
is reckoned more heinous among us than any punishment and
any death. Nor yet doth your cruelty, though each act be
more exquisite than the last, profit you; it is rather an attrac-
tion to our sect. We spring up in greater numbers the more we
are mown down by you: the blood 01 1116 Christians is the seed
