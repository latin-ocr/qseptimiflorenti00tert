events. But it was in the way we have mentioned above that
the Pythian Apollo reported the boiling of a tortoise with the
flesh of a sheep3 a moment had taken him to Lydia. From the
fact that they inhabit the air and from the neighbourhood of
the stars and from their dealings with the clouds they are able
to have knowledge of the preparations in heaven, so that they
can even promise rains which they already feel. They are also
clearly sorcerersl in their treatments of disease. For they first
injure, and then prescribe remedies to excite wonder, whether
simply new or absolutely opposed to the usual practices, after
which they cease to injure, and are (thus) believed to have
effected a cure. Why then should I speak of other subtilties
or even powers of spiritual deception? the appearances of the
Castors, and the water borne in a sieve, and the ship propelled
by a girdle, and the beard made red at a touch,—so that stones

might be believed to be divinities, and the true God should not
be sought after?

CHAP. XXIII. Moreover, if magicians also call forth
apparitions and dishonour the souls of those already dead, if
they put children to death to get an oracular utterance, if they
perform many wonders with mountebank trickery, if they also
let loose dreams, having to stand by them the power of angels
and spirits once for all invited, through whom both goats and
tables have been wont to give oracles, how much more would
that power of its own initiative and on behalf of its own business
exert itself with all its strength to carry out the same work,
which it performs to serve the business of another! Or if both
angels and daemons work the sanie things as your gods also
work, where then lies the preeminence of divinity, which must
of course be believed to be superior to every (other) power?
Will it not then be more fitting to assume that it is the persons
themselves who make themselves gods, since they display the
same actions which produce belief in divinity, than to imagine
that the gods are merely on a level with angels and daemons?
A distinction is made, I suppose, according to the difference of
localities, so that from their temples you judge those to be gods,
whom in other places you do not call gods3 so that one who
flies through sacred towers is considered to suffer from one kind
of madness, while one who leaps over the houses in the neigh-
bourhood is considered to suffer from another, and one power
is declared to exist in him who cuts off his organs of generation
or his arms, and another in him who cuts off his tongue. The

result of the madness is alike in both cases and there is one
