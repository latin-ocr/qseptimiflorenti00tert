xviii INTRODUCTION

Of the adaptations of Freund I have for many years employed
two copies of Riddle-White, and (of late) two copies of Lewis-
Short‚ as a basis for annotations3 but young scholars, who
use a lexicon not so much to add to or correct its statements,
as to learn the usage of the language, ought to employ Gesner
or Forcellini or Scheller habitually. For a portion of the
alphabet (from D—K) by far the completest storehouse is the
'Thesaurus der klassischen Latinitat,’ begun by Georges, and
continued from D onwards by Gustav Muhlmann (Leipz.
1854—68).

Any of the old Latin-English lexicons, from Cooper to the
complete editions of Ainsworth, give far more racy, homespun
English for the Latin words, than the books which now com-
mand the market. Lewis-Short has an improved orthography
and some additions from Georges and various commentaries3
also a few articles (eg. curn conj. and prep., sui, suus) are care-
fully and independently executed3 but in some points the
changes from Riddle-White are for the worse.

In the ‘ Bibliographical Clue to Latin Literature' I recorded
under each author the then aids (indexes cet.) to the study of
his language; it is well to remember that the ‘Delphin'
classics (Valpy’s reprint is very accurate, and adds many useful
commentaries to the original quartos) and also Lemaire’s supply
complete indexes to many authors. Merguet is about half way
through the Herculean task of a concordance to Cicero3 he
and others have brought out three rival lexicons to Caesar:
Teubner’s press is engaged on lexicons to Livy and Tacitusl.
ln Teubner’s ‘bibliotheca' some authors, chiefly technical, as
Cassius Felix, Iulius Valerius cet., are furnished with indexes.
The Berlin ‘Monumenta Germaniae historica' and the Vienna
library of the fathers have indeed indexes, but in many cases
by no means exhaustive; eg. not Reifferscheid, but Forcellini,
informs us that the rare word bacula (dim. of baca) occurs
thrice in Arnobius. Of late years the French have returned to
the field in which they reigned supreme in the lssth and l7th

and Greef's Lexicon Taciteum is complete. The Scriptores Historiae Auqustae
have been done by Lessing, and other authors by others. A. S.]
