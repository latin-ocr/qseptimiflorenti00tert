APOLOGETICVS 15, 16 53

If however I were to add—what will be equally admitted by
the consciences of all—that adulteries are arranged in the
temples, that panders ply their trade among the altars, that often
in the very roonis of sacristans and priests, under the same fillets
and sacred caps and purple vestments, lust is satisfied while the
incense is burning, I know not whether your gods may not find
more reason to complain about you than about the Christians.
Certainly those guilty of sacrilege are always of your number.
For the Christians do not know the teniples even by day.
Perhaps they might also rob them themselves, if they them-
selves also did reverence to them. What then do they worship
who do not worship such things? Already indeed it is easy
to be understood that those are worshippers of the truth who
are not worshippers of a lie, and that they no longer err in a
matter in which the recognition of previous error taught them
to give it up. Grasp this fact first, and thence gather the
whole order of our mystery, first however reJ'ecting certain
, false notions.

CHAP. XVI. For you, too, like some others, have dreamed
that an ass’s head is the object of our worship. The fancy of
such a deity was put into their minds by Cornelius Tacitus,who in
the fifth of his Histories, having begun his account of the J ewish
War with an account of the origin of the race, and having also
discussed at his pleasure alike the origin itself and the name and
religion of the race, records that the Jews, having been freed
or, as he thought, exiled from Egypt, when they were weakened
through thirst in the deserts of Arabia, where water was very
scarce, employed some wild asses to guide them to a spring,
thinking that they would probably be seeking water after food,
and on that account consecrated the form of a similar animal.
And hence I think it was presumed that we, too, being thus allied
to the J ewish religion were taught to do reverence to the same
image. But indeed it is the same Cornelius Tacitus, truly the
most inventive of romancers, who in the same history records
that Gnaeus Pompeius, after capturing Jerusalem and thus
going to the temple to investigate the secrets of the Jewish
religion, found no image therein. And to be sure, if the
object of worship was represented by some figure, this would
have been most appropriately shown in its own shrine, the
rather that the worship, however vain, had no sear of strangers
to witness it ; only the priests were allowed to approach, while
the gaze of the rest was forbidden by a curtain spread out over

it. And yet you will not deny that you pay divine honours to
