old gods are no nobler, yet they will consider it an insult paid
to them from yon, that this privilege, which antiquity con-
ferred on them alone, has been allowed to others also.

CHAP. XIV. Ι 3111 unwilling1 to go further and review your
sacred rites. I do not say what is your method in sacrificing,
which leads you to slaughter every worn-out, putrefying and
mangy creature, to cut 011 311 the useless parts from the prime and
sound beasts, the little heads and the hoofs, which even at home
you would have set apart for slaves or dogs, your placing on
Hercules' altar 01 not even 3 third part of the tithe that is due
to him. I will rather praise your wisdom in rescuing something
of what is in danger 01 being lost. But when I turn to your
literature, whence you derive instruction in prac'tical wisdom,
and the duties of gentlemen, what ridiculous situations do Ι
find! gods engaged like pairs 01 gladiators and fighting des-
perately together on account 01 the Trojans and the Achaeans,
Venus wounded by an arrow from a human hand, because she
wished to snatch her son Aeneas, when almost killed, from the
same Diomede (who had wounded herself) 3 Mars reduced almost
to a shadow by thirteen months in chains, Jupiter rescued by
the agency 01 001110 monster from meeting the same violence at
the hands 01 13110 0131101 divinities, and at one time weeping the
misfortune 01 Sarpedon, at another burning with shameful lust
for his sister, and telling her the while 01 the mistresses in the
long past, none 01 them so much loved as she. Since that time
what poet may not be found calumniating the gods, on the
authority 01 13110 011101 01 1110 craft? One makes over Apollo to
king Admetus to feed his flocks, another lets out Neptune's
services in building to Laomedon. There is also the great lyric
poet (I mean Pindar), who sings that Aesculapius was deservedly
punished with a thunderbolt by reason 01 1110 greed, which made
him practise the healing art injuriously. Jupiter is evil, if
the thunderbolt is his, devoid 01 1131311131 feeling 101 1110 grandson,
and jealous 01 the skilled practitioner. Such stories ought
never to have been revealed if true3 if 13100, ought never to
have been invented, among really religious people. Nor do the
writers 01 tragedies or comedies refrain from publishing in their
prologues the sorrows or wanderings 01 13110 family of some god.
Ι say nothing 01 the philosophers, being quite content with 2
Socrates, who, in mockery of the gods, swore by the oak and
the goat and the dog. But (say you) Socrates was condemned
for that very reason, because he tried to do away with the gods.
