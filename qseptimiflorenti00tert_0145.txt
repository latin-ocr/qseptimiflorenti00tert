touch the heart 01 God, and when we have wrested mercy
(from Him), Jupiter gets the honour.

CHAP. XLI. You therefore are dangerous to human affairs,
x ou are to blame 101 public misfortunes,d1axx1ng them always
upon us, since V ou despise God and w orship statues For surely
it is more likelx that one who 13 neglected should get angry
rather than those 1111110 are worshipped Otherwise they are
indeed most 11111611,11 011 account 01 the (hristians they injure
theii 011 11 11 orshippers also, 1111110111 they ought to keep unafiected
by the deserts 01 the Christians. ‘This,’ you say, ‘is to retort
on your own god also, 11 116 himself allows his own worshippers
6130 to be injured on account 01 the profanes Learn first 1113
plans, and you will not then retort. For He who 1163 01106 for
611 ordained 611 everlasting judgnient after the end 01 the world,
does not hasten the separation, which 13 6 circumstance 01 the

follows that all the plagues 01 the world come from God on us,
it may be, for warning, but on you 101 punishment. And yet we
are not really injured at all, in the first place because we have
no concern in this 1116 except to depart 110111 it as speedily as
possible, in the second place because, 11 any missortune is brought
upon us, it is attributed to your deserts. But even 11 301116
troubles touch us also 63 being connected with you, we rejoice
more in the recognition 01 the divine prophecies, which 01

But 11 it be the case that all these evils come upon you on our

to worship beings so ungrateful and so unjust, whose duty it
was rather to help and defend you in the suffering coming from

the Christians, since it was their duty to keep you apart from

CHAP. XLII. But we are arraigned also on a different
charge 01 injuries inflicted, and we are said to be unprofitable
in business matters. How can this be true 01 men who live
