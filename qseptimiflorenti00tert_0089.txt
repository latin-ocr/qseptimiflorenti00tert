years earlier than the overthrow 01 Ρ113111; Ι might also add
‘and Homer too’ by more than 500 years, seeing I have authorities
101 this statement. With regard to the other prophets also,
although they are later than Moses, are not the very latest 01
1110111 nevertheless found to be earlier than your earliest philo-
sophers, legislators and historians? By what successions these
statements can be proved it is not so much a difficult as it is
an immense task 101 us to set forth, nor is it really difficult, but
at this stage it would take too long. We should have to settle
ourselves down to many documents with calculating movements
01 the fingers, we should have to unlock the archives even 01
1110 most ancient peoples, the Egyptians, the Chaldaeans, the
Phoenicians. We should have to call in fellow-citizens 01 those
by whom this knowledge has been supplied, some Egyptian
Manetho and some Chaldean Berosus, but also Hiram the
Phoenician, king 01 Tyre; their successors also, Ptolemy 01
Mendes and Menander 01 Ephesus and Demetrius 01 Ρ1131010111
and King Juba and Apion and Thallus, and either to confirm
or 101010 these, the Jew Josephus, the native champion 01
Jewish antiquities. The census-books 01 1110 Greeks must also
be compared, that what things were done at what time or the
sequence 01 events may be made known, so as to throw light
011 1110 ohronology 01 historical events 3 we must make excursions
into the histories and literature 01 11ιο world. And yet we have
already brought forward about 11311 01 001 proof, when we have
given a sprinkling 01 1110 means by which they can be proved.
But it is better to postpone (our proof), lest we should either
accomplish less in our haste or digress too 131 111 001 treatment.

CHAP. XX. In place 01 this deferred proof I now offer you
something more, the majesty 01 the Scriptures, if we cannot
prove them to be divine because 01 their age, 11 111011 age is
questionable. Nor is this to be learnt slowly or from some other
source; your instructors are before your eyes3 the world and
the age and the course 01 history. Whatsoever is taking place,
was prophesied, Whatsoever is now seen, was heard 01; 1110
swallowing up 01 cities by the earth, the encroachment on islands
by the sea, the slaughters caused by foreign and domestic wars,
the clash 01 kingdoms upon kingdoms, the devastation produced
by famine and pestilence, and all local disasters and the great
frequency 01 deaths; the humble are exalted and the lofty
abased; the growing infrequency 01 justice, the growing 110-
quency 01 injustice, the decay 01 1110 0310 101 311 noble lessons,
the deviations in the functions 01 the seasons and the duties
01 1110 elements, the disturbance in the shape 01 11310131 objects
