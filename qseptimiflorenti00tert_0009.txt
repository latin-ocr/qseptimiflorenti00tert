PREFAOE

THE late Professor John E. Β. Mayor, during his tenure of
the professorship of Latin at Cambridge, frequently lectured
on the Apoloyy of Tertullian in the Divinity Schools. About
the year 1892 116 wrote out his notes in a copy of Oehler’s
earlier edition (Halle, 1849), that had been interleaved with
sheets of paper about twice the size of the pages of the book
itself These notes were added to from time to time down to
the year 1907,11 1101 16161, and they formed the matter of his
lecturos. Already 111 1893 116 ⁴began to publish them in The
Journal of Philoloyy, but the publication never went beyond

Ἴ 1116 end of the fifth chapter. s

After his death 011 December l, 1910, his executors considered
the advisability of publishing the whole of the notes, and
honoured me with 1116 request to edit 1116111 for publication
I had heard the lectures throughout two or 111016 1611116 of my
undergraduate period at Cambridge, and had been profoundl}
influenced by them.1 therefore felt it binding on me to
suspend my own work and perform this 661 01 metas,

The executors first arranged with Mr E. S. Payne of Clifton,
Bristol, for a copy of the notes as a basis for the proposed
publication. Though the Professor’s handwriting is beautifully
clear, it is at the same time so microscopic that this was no
light task to perform. Mr Payne also verified many of the
references, and appended a number of useful remarks on the
notes themselves.

It may be at once admitted that only the Professor himself,
or some one equally learned, could edit these notes in a satis-
factory manner. I 6111 fully conscious of my own unfitness
for the task‚ which has been very heavy. I have felt it necessary
to compare Mr Payne’s copy with the original MS, in which
work I received valued help froin the friend of thirty years,
Mr J ames Taylor 01 1116 Aberdeen Centre for the Training of
Teachers; but this is only part of what was required. I have
had to put the notes in correct sequence, to reduce to order
vthe somewhat chaotic state of the references and quotations
within the notes themselves, to supply references never filled
