which proceeded at once to destroy theatres as they rose for the
corruption of morals, which did not allow the badges of office
or noble birth to be employed lightly or with impunity‘.l (I ask
these questions) for Ι see dinners, which can only be called
centuries from the 1ΟΟ,ΟΟΟ sesterces they cost, and whole mines
of silver worked out into plates‚ a small thing if they were the
property of senators only and not of freedmen or of those who
are still liable to be flogged. I see too that one theatre, 01 a
theatre open to the sky, is not enough for each town3 for
doubtless it was to prevent their immodest pleasure from being
too cold in winter, that the Spartans first invented their
cloak for the sports. I see too that there is no (111101011οο 1011
between the dress of matrons and that of prostitutes. Indeed
with regard to women even those customs of our anc'estors have
fallen into disuse, which protected modesty and sobriety, in an
age when no woman knew aught of gold save on the one finger
which the bridegroom had claimed for himself with the wedding
ring, and when women abstained from wine to such a degree,
that her relatives put a matron to death by starvation for
breaking open the bins of the wine-cellar. Under Romulus
indeed one who had touched wine was put to death with im-
punity by her husband Metennius. For the same reason they
were also even obliged to offer kisses to their kinsfolk, that they
might be judged by their breath. Where is now that happinessv
of married life so successful in 'point of morals at any rate, the
result of which was that for about six hundred years after the
foundation of Rome a writing of divorce was unknown? But
now in the case of women every part of the body is weighted
with gold, no kiss is free owing to wine, and divorce is now
the object 01 prayer, as the natural fruit 01 marriage. Even
with regard to your gods themselves the wise decrees 01 your
ancestors with their application to the future have been re-
scinded by you, the very people who plume yourselves on
your obedience to thern. The consuls on the authority 01
1110 senate banished Father Bacchus with his mysteries not
only from the capital but from 1110 whole 01 Italy. Serapis
and Isis and Harpocrates with their dog-headed attendant
were forbidden the Capitol, in other words were expelled
from the parliament 01 1110 gods, their altars overturned and
themselves banished by the consuls Piso and Gabinius, who
were assuredly no Christians, with a view to check the vices
arising from their base and idle superstitions. But these you
have restored, and conferred on them the highest dignity. Where
