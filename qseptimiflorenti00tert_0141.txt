lasciviousness, but to the same care 101 orderliness and modesty,
36 111066 who have fed, not so much on meats as on instruction
in righteousness. This meeting together 01 Christians would
have been deservedly illegal, I admit, if it were the same as
the illegal, deservedly to be condemned, 11 any one complains 01
11 with the same accusation as is made about clubs. For whose
111111 have we ever met? We are the same when gathered
together as we are when scattered, we are as a body what we
are also as individuals, injuring no one, paining no one. When
worthy, when good men come together, when the pious and
pure are gathered together, it is to be called not a club, but a
council chamber.

CHAP. XL. But on the contrary the name 01 13611011 16 to
116 applied to those who conspire to foment hatred against good
and worthy persons, who cry aloud against the blood 01 1116
innocent, pretending forsooth in (16161166 01 their hatred that
10011611 excuse besides, that the Christians are to blame 101
every public disaster, every misfortune that happens to the
people. Ι1 the Tiber rises to the walls, 11 the Nile does not
rise to the fields, 11 1116 sky is rainless, 11 there is an earthquake,
a famine, a plague, immediately the cry arises, ‘The Christians
to 1116 lion!> What! so many to one (11011)ἶἰ Ι pray you tell
me: 1161016 1116 time 01 Tiberius, that is, before the coming
01 Christ, how many disasters smote the world or particular
cities'? We read that Hiera, Anaphe and Delos and Rhodes
and Ophiusa1 were ruined with many thousands 01 persons.
Plato also mentions that a land greater than Asia or Africa

, was snatched away by the Atlantic Ooean. But an earth-

quake also drained the Corinthian sea, and the force 01 the

= waves cut 011 Lucania and banished it to bear the name 01

Sicily. These things 01 6011166 could not happen without harm
to the inhabitants. But where were at that time, I will not
say, the Christians who think nothing 01 your gods, but your
gods themselves, when a flood overwhelmed the whole world, or,
as Plato supposed, only the plain32 For, that your gods are
later than the catastrophe 01 the flood, is attested by the very
cities in which they were born and died, or even which they
founded3 for otherwise they would not have remained to-day,
if they had not been later than that disaster. Palestine had not
yet received its Jewish swarm 110111 Egypt, nor yet had the
beginning 01 the Christian sect settled there, when a shower 01 ’
fire burnt up the neighbouring regions 01 Sodom and Gomorrha.
