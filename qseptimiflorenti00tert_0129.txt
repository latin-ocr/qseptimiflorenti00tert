APOLOGETICVS 35 105

populace 01 1110 seven hills, I charge you to say whether that
Roman tongue spares any Caesar belonging to 111. Witness
not the Tiber onlv but the training- schools Μο1 1111(1 beasts as well.
Again, 11 nature had diawn over our breasts some transparent
substance thiough which the light could pass, who is there
whose heart would not appear to be engraved 111111 the likcness
01 0110 new Caesar 31101 311011101, presiding over the distribution
of a (101οῖ Even at that 110111 at vs hich they shout:

‘May Jupiter add years 10 11111110 1110111 ours!

These words the Christian is just‘as unable to utter as he is to
pray 101 this in the case 01 3 new Caesar. But it is the mob, you
say. Though it is the mob, yet they are Romans, and 110110
demand the Christians for punishment more eagerly than the
mob. No doubt the other classes 01 society, in proportion
to their authority, are religious 110111 conviction3 nothing
hostile breathes 110111 the senate itself, 110111 the knights, 110111
the army, from the palace itself. Whencc come the Cassii and
the Nigri and the Albini? Whencc those who besiege Caesar
between the two hay-trees? Whencc those who practise gym-
nastic exercises in order to strangle 1111112 Whencc those who
rush armed into the palace, more reckless than all the number 01
the Sigerii and Parthenii? All 001110110111 among the Romans, 11
Ι 3111 not mistaken, that 18, 110111 among the pagans. And yet all
these traitors up to the actual outbreak 01 disloyalty were both
sacrificing 101 the safety 01 the emperor and swearing by his
genius, some out 01 (10018, others within, and 01 course they
were giving the name 01 public enemies to the Christians.
But even those who are now daily revealed as the accomplices
or abettors 01 criminal factions, the gleanings that still remain
after the vintage 01 parricides, how they decked out their doors
with the freshest and most luxuriant bay-trees, how they
darkened their porches with the tallest and brightest lamps,
with what elegant and splendid couches did they divide up the
market-place among themselves, not that they might celebrate
the joy 01 the people, but that they might now learn
private prayers in a ceremony connected with another and
might install both a copy and a picture 01 their hope, while
changing mentally the name 01 the emperor! These same
dutiful services 310 paid also by those who consult astrologers
and soothsayers and augurs and magicians about the lives 01
the Caesars, which arts, as having been introduced by the
apostate angels and forbidden by God, the Christians never
q employ even for their own concerns. Moreover, who needs to
