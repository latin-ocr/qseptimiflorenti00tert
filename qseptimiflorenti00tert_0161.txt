out 01 what was once a woman, and should by 10106 01 eloquence
have twisted all arguments to support that opinion, will he not
gain assent and establish belief in abstaining even from animal

to promise that man would be made again from man and that
very Gaius would be reproduced 110111 Gaius, the people will
rather insist on stoning him, and will not even come to hear
him. Ι1 there rules any method 101 the reincarnation 01 501115,
why should they not return into the same nature, since resto-
ration means this, to be that which it had 116602 Now they
are not the very souls that they had been, because they have
not been able to be that which they were not, unless they were
to 06356 to be that which they had been. There will be need also
