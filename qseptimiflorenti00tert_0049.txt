language 113611 you have abandoned your ancestors. You are
always praising old times, but you change your position 110111
day to day. By this it is shown that, in departing 110111 1116
good customs 01 your ancestors, you retain and preserve those
which you ought not, while you have not preserved those which
you ought. Even the very thing that you still seem most faith-
fully to guard, as handed down by your ancestors, that in which
most 01 311 you have marked the Christians as guilty 01 113113-
gression, I mean zeal in the worship of the gods, (concerning
which early ages made the greatest mistakes,) although you have
built up again the altars to Serapis, now become a Roman,
although you present the frantie orgies 01 your worship to
Bacchus, now an Italian, I will show in the proper place that
these are alike looked down upon and slighted and undermined
by you against the authority 01 your ancestors. But now I will
reply to that evil reputation 101 360161 01111163, to clear my way

CHAP. VII. We are called abominable 110111 the sacrament

01 11113111101(16 and the feeding thereon, as well as the incestuous
intercourse, following the banquet, because the dogs, that over—
turn the lamps, (our pimps forsooth 01 1116 darkness) bring
about the shamelessness engendered by our impious lusts.
Yet we are but called so on each occasion, and you take no pains
to bring to light what we have been so long charged with. There-
fore either prove the fact, 11 you believe it, or 1611136 10 believe it,
you who have not proved it. For your want 01 straightforward-
ness a preliminary objection is raised against you, that that
cannot be true which not even you yourselves dare to search out.
It is quite a different duty that you lay upon the executioner
against the Christians‚ namely, not that they should say 01 what
they are guilty, but that they should deny what they are. The
beginning 01 11113 teaching, as I have already stated, dates 110111
Tiberius. Truth from the first was accompanied by hatred 01
herself: 110111 1161 first appearance she is an enemy. She has
as many enemies as there are strangers to her, the Jews indeed
quite specially so 110111 jealousy, the soldiers 110111 111611 violence,
and even the very members 01 0111 households from natural ill-
feeling. We are daily besieged, we are daily betrayed, even
in our very meetings and assemblies we are frequently surprised.
Who ever came upon an infant wailing under such circumstances?
Who ever kept 101 1116 judge the bloodstained faces 01 Cyclopes
and Sirens just as he had found them? Who detected even on
v our wives any trace 01 impurity? Who when he had discovered
such crimes, concealed them or sold his concealment 01 1116111,
