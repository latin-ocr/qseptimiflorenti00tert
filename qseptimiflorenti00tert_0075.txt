APOLOGETICVS 14, 15 51

Plainly! because the truth has long, or rather always, been an
object of hatred. Nevertheless, when the Athenians, from
remorse for the sentence they h'ad passed, not only afterwards
punished the prosecutors of Socrates but also placed a golden
statue of him in a temple, the reversal of the condemnation
gave a new testimony to Socrates. But Diogenes too made
some witticism at Hercules’ expense, and the Roman Cynic,
Varro, introduces a whole host of headless Joves (or Jupiters
as they ought perhaps to be called).

CHAP. XV. The rest of your licentious wits also work for
your pleasures through the dishonour of the gods. Examine
the farces of. the Lentuli and Hostilii, and consider whether it is
the buffoons or your gods whose jokes and tri cks you are laughing
at; such subjects as an adulterous Anubis, a masculine Moon,
Diana scourged, the will of the deceased Jupiter read aloud,
and three starving Herculeses held up to ridicule. Moreover
the writings of the playwrights also give form to all their
filthiness. · The Sun-god mourns his son cast from heaven, while
you rejoice, and Cybele sighs for her disdainful shepherd, while
you are no whit ashamed, and you can endure to listen to the
song which tells the sins of Jupiter, and the trial of Juno,
Venus and Minerva by the shepherd. What of the fact that
a mask representing a god of yours covers the head of a branded
and notorious person, that an unclean body prolonged for this
accomplishment by emasculation represents a Minerva or a
Hercules—is not their majesty outraged and their divinity
prostituted, while you applaudZ You are clearly more religious
in the amphitheatre, where your gods in like manner dance on
human blood, on the marks of punishments undergone, pro-
viding plots and narratives for criminals, save and except that
criminals often put on the character of your gods themselves
also. We have sometimes witnessed the mutilation of Attis,
the famous god of Pessinus, and a man who was burning alive
had personated Hercules. We have laughed too amidst the
sportive atrocities of the midday comba-tants, at Mercury testing
apparent deaths with a branding—iron3 we have likewise seen
Jupiter’s brother dragging down the corpses of gladiators with
a hammer in his hand (to finish those who were not quite dead).
But who could even inquire into these absurdities one by one?
If they disquiet the honour of the gods, if they obliterate all
traces of divinity, surely they take their rise in the contempt
both of those who practise such things and of those for whom
'they practise them. But those you will say are mere shows.
