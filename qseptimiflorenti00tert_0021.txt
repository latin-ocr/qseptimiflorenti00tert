INTRODUCTION xvii

remark that Rigault’s glossary is convenient for annotation.
This book and Blunt’s manuscript lectures on the early fathers
should certainly be secured for the university which he adorned.
The Germans are no doubt the most active workers in the

patristic vineyard3 but how few of them are scholars like
Burton or Blunt, Kaye or Field!

LANGUAGE.

Of existing glossaries to Tertullian, those of Rigault,
Semler (also in Migne) and (the best) Oehler, all are necessary.
[The language of Tertullian, so far as comprised in the two
already published volumes of the Vienna edition, has been
completely recorded on slips for the Thesaurus Linquere Latinae.
A complete index to the Apoloyetz'cus has been made by Henen:
see the additions to the Bibliography. A. S.] Genera] lexicons
of independent value are Faberl (best ed. by Leichius, Francos.
1749, fol.), a favorite with Dr Westcott; Rob. Stephens (ed.
Gesner, 4 vols. 17493 the ed. of Ant. Birr, Basil. 1740, fol.
4 vols„ has inedited notes of Henry Stephens); Forcellini,
two editions of which are still incomplete, that by De Vit
(lexicon and glossary and a large part of the Valuable ‘Ono-
masticon' have appeared), and that by Corradini (incorporating
Klotz); Scheller (Srd ed. Leipz. 1804—5, 5 vols. 8v03 I have
Madvig’s copy), translated, without the instructive and pathetic
preface, by Riddle for the Oxford Press (fol.); Klotz3 (Freund's
book, which has supplied the basis of ninety-nine hundredths
of the lexicons sold in England for many years, is, after the
letter O, a most careless compilation from Forcellini); and,
fullest of all in vocabulary, and necessary as a supplement
even to Forcellini, Georges. [This honour now belongs to
Nouveau Dictiouuaz're Latin-Fraucais...par E. Benoist et H.
Goelzer, Paris 1893, for the whole alphabet, to the 8th edition
of Georges by his son H. Georges, Hannover and Leipzig,
1912—1916, for three quarters, and to the Thesaurus Linguae
Latinae, Leipzig, 1900 ff„ for A—Dimico, F—Familia. A. S.]

of Classical and Sacred Philology Π (Cambr. 1855), 277—290.
