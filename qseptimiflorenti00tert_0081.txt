stated these methods more fully, to avoid passing over, as it
were purposely, any rumour without rebutting it. All these
false opinions we have now cleared away and proceed to turnl
to the proof of our religion.

CHAP. XVII. The object of our worship is one God, who
through the word by which he commanded (that they should
exist), the reason by which he arranged them, the power by
which he could (carry out his will), fashioned out of nothing all
this mass with all its apparatus of elements, bodies and spirits,
for an ornament to his own greatness, whence it is that the
Greeks also have applied the name κόσμος (ornament) to the
universe. He is invisible, though he may be seen3 incompre-
hensible, though he is represented to men through his grace,
inestimable, though he can be estimated through the human
senses; therefore is he the true and the mighty God. What is
capable, however, of being generally seen, of being grasped, of
being valued, is less both than the eyes by which it is caught,
than the hands by which it is touched, and the thoughts by
which it is discovered ; but that which is immeasurable is known
only to itself. This is what makes God valued, while yet he
is incapable of valuation. Thus it is that the power of his
greatness presents him as both known and unknown to men.
And this is the substance of their offence, that they refuse to
recognise him of whom they cannot be ignorant. Do you wish
that we should prove this from his own works, so many and of
such a character, by which we are restrained, upheld, delighted3
nay even by which we are terrified, or should we prove it even
from the evidence of the soul itselffl Although weighed down
by the prison of the body, though confined by evil customs,
though emasculated by lusts and passions, though enslaved to
false gods, yet, when it recovers its senses, as after surfeit, as
after sleep, as after some illness, when it becomes conscious 01 its
own health, it names God, for the sole reason that he alone is
by nature the true God. ‘ Good God,’ ‘Great God ³ and ‘Which
may God grant' are expressions used by all. That he is also a
judge is attested by the words: ‘God sees,' ‘I commend to
God,’ and ‘God will recompense me.' O evidence of the
natural Christianity of the soul! For when uttering these
words it looks not to the Capitol, but to the sky. It knows
indeed the place of abode of the living God3 from him and
from there2 it descended.
