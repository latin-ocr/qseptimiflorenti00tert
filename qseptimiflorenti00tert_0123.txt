also that is foul3 so that I wonder, when the victims are tested
among you by vicious priests, when any one judges the hearts
rather 01 1116 victims than 01 1116 sacrificers themselves. There-
fore let hooks thus dig into us while 0111 hands are spread out to
G0d‚ let crosses suspend us, let fires play about us, let swords
behead us, let wild—beasts leap upon us ; 1116 very attitude 01
1116 praying Christian is ready 101 every kind 01 capital punish—
ment. This is your duty, ye excellent governors‚ wrench out
a soul that is praying to God 101 1116 emperor. The crime will
be found there, where is the truth 01 6 God and piety to him.

CHAP. XXXI. Now they tell us that we have fawned upon
the emperor and uttered lying Ρ1657615, 01 0011156 with the
view 01 escaping violence. Clearly this deception is to our
benefit ; 101 you allow that we make good whatever point we
defend. You therefore who have thought that we care nothing
101 1116 5616157 01 1116 Caesars, look into our Scripture, the oracles
01 God, which we ourselves do not conceal and many accidents
bring into the hands 01 strangers. Know from these that we
are taught to the point 01 superfluity 01 kindness even to pray
God for our enemies and to entreat benefits 101 0111 perse-
cutors. Who are 10 6 greater extent enemies and persecutors
01 1116 Christians than those about whose majesty we are
arraignedZ But even by name and clearly: ‘Pray,’ says (the
scripture), ‘for kings and 101 0111615 and 101 powers, that all
things may be at peace 101 57011.’ For when the empire is
shattered, and when the other parts 01 11 6150 616 shattered,
we too 01 0011156, although the crowd considers us foreigners,
are involved in some quarter 01 1116 disaster.

OHAP. XXXII. There is also another greater necessity 101
us to pray for emperors, even 101 1116 whole state 01 1116 Empire
and the 1011111165 01 Rome, since we know that the great force
which is threatening the whole world and the end 115611 01 world-
history which threatens terrible afflictions is being kept back
. by the respite granted to the Roman empire. Therefore we

are unwilling to experience this, and while we pray 101 115 post-
ponement we are favouring the long continuance 01 Rome. But
we also swear‚ though not by the genii 01 1116 0665615, yet by
Χ 111611 5616157, which is more divine than any genii. Do you not
know that genii is a name 101 daemones and 101 daemonia, a
diminutive word derived 110111 it? We look up to the judgment
μ01 Grod in the emperors, 101 Η6 561 1116111 over the races 01 1116
world. We know that that is in them which God willed, and
so we wish that also to be 5616 which God willed‚ and we consider
