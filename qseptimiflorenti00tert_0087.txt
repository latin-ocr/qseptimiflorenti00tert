with us or like ours. It is from sophia (wisdom) that the 10178

the imitation 01 113 1188 borrowed the divination 01 the poets.
If men found anything that was glorious, they corrupted it to
make it their own. Even fruits have degenerated 110111 13118
quality 01 the seed. In many 1111131181 ways Ι might join issue
011 13118 antiquity 01 13118 sacred writings, were it not that they
derive a greater weight 01 credibility from the strength 01 their
truth than from the records 01 their age. For what will support
its evidence more powerfully than the daily testing 01 8 whole

age, when the arrangements 01 kingdoms, the 1811 01 0113188, the =

destruction 01 nations, the situations at particular times, corre-
spond exactly to the prophecies about them made thousands 01
years before? Hence our hope, at which you laugh, receives
fresh 1118, and our confidence, which you 0811 88811181108, 18
strengthened. For it is natural that an examination 01 13118 past
should lead us to put confidence in the future. The 8811181
words prophesied both past and future, the same writings have
signified 13118111. Τ11118, which among us seems to be divided into
parts, is but one in those writings. Consequently all that remains
unverified is already 101 118 verified‚ because it was prophesied
along with those events which were 1311811 111 the future and have
(since) been verified. You also have, 11 Ι am not mistaken‚ a
Sibyl. I mention her because this name of the true prophetess
01 the true God has been everywhere used beyond all others,
who seemed to have the gift 01 prophecy, as2 your Sibyls have
falsely employed the name instead 01 13118 131118 0118, 817811 88 your

that as yet Ι have been putting it too feebly-your very gods
I say, the very temples and 0180188 and sacred rites, are some-
times centuries antedated by one prophet’s book, in which the
treasure 01 the whole Jewish religion, and hence 01 01118 also,
seems to have been placed. Ι1 meantime you have heard 01
some Moses, he is 88 old 88 the Argive Inachus: by almost four
hundred years—actually seven less—he precedes Danaus who
is himself too the oldest among you, and he is about a thousand
