(although it does matter whether it is child-murder or homicide)
I will appeal to the people. How many of those standing around
and panting for the blood of the Christians, aye even of your-

· selves, magistrates most just and severe against us, should I prick

in their consciences, for putting to death the children born to
them? Since there is a difference also in the manner of the
death, it is assuredly more cruel to suffocate them by drowning
or to expose them to cold and starvation and the dogs, for
even an older person would prefer to die by the sword. But
to us, to whom homicide has been once for all forbidden, it is
not permitted to break up even what has been conceived in the
womb, while as yet the blood is being drawn (from the parent
body) for a human life. Prevention of birth is premature murder,
and it makes no difference whether it is a life already born that
one snatches away, or a life in the act of being born that one
destroys3 that which is to be a human-being is also huniam,
the whole fruit is already actually present in the seed. With
regard to banquets of blood and such like tragic dishes, you may
read whether it is not somewhere stated (it is in Herodotus,
I think) that certain tribes had arranged the tasting of blood
drawn from the arms of both sides to signify ratification of a
treaty. Something of the same kind was tasted also under
Catiline. They say that among certain tribesmen of the
Scythians also each dead person becomes food for his own
relations. But I am wandering too far. On this very day,
in this very country, blood from a wounded thigh, caught in
a palm of the hand and given to her worshippers to drink,
marks the votariesl of Bellona. Again, what of those who, by
way of healing epilepsy, at the gladiatorial show, drain with
eager thirst the blood of slaughtered criminals, while it is still
fresh and flowing down from the throat? Or what of those,
who dine on bits of wild—beast from the arena, who seek a slice
of boar or stag? That boar in the struggle wiped off the blood
from him whom he had first stained with gore; that stag
wallowed in a gladiator’s blood. The paunches of the very
bears are eagerly sought, while they are yet gorged with un-
digested human fiesh; thus flesh that has been fed on man is
forthwith vomited by man. You that eat such things, how far
removed you are from the feasts of the Christians! But are
those others less guilty, who with savage lust gloat over human
bodies, because they devour them alive? are they any the less
dedicated to filth by human blood, because they lick up what
is about to become blood? they do not absolutely eat infants,
but rather those that are grown up. Your crimes ought to
