we know o‘f ancient religion, a very large number of perfectly
Classical wordS‚ have been preserved to us only by the fathersl.
Look at the fragments of Seneca, collect the fragments of
Varro, and you will see that it is not saie to say to Christian
authors: non licet esse uos. I have found abundant evidence
in patristic Greek and Latin for many words known to the
lexicons only by citations in glossaries. R'onsch, Paucker,
Georges, supply students os Romance languages with hundreds
of words hitherto unregistered, the parents of a numerous
Italian, Spanish, French progeny.

Again, many of the chief classics, as Pindar and Thucydides,
are very difficult2, or (as tragic choruses) very corrupt. Many oi
the fathers write very simply, and might serve admirably for
the neglected discipline of the ear3 even as Cicero and the
younger Pliny pursued their studies by the aid of readers. It
is certain that an entire volume of either Chrysostom (Dio—to
name a heathen—or John) could be read carefully in shorter
time than is spent on the study of the few hundred lines of the
Agamemnon. And the path through the former would be all
luminous, through the latter dark with corruptions and conjec-
tures and despairing interpretations. Many of the best scholars,
as in England Pearson, John Davies, Wasse (much of whose
work remains in manuscript), Routh, Kaye, F. Field‚ Chr.
Wordsworth, Lightfoot, have devoted their best energies to the
elucidation of the fathers. As a rule patristic and biblical texts
are preserved in earlier manuscripts than those of heathen
classics3 so that palaeographers must necessarily sit at the feet
of divines.

For the order of study, Ι would say: Leave to the infallible
oracles of monthly magazines sweeping hypotheses, no whit less
hazardous than those of Father Hardouin. First become
thoroughly familiar with the ancients themselves, before you

1 shewed that hic esto (also hic sum) the correlative of the istic sum (⁴1 am
with you,’ i.e. ‘I am attending’) of Cicero and Terence, is to be gleaned from
Augustino.

'2 This remark was once made to me by Mr Bywater. He said: “one
could read a very large part of such a writer as Plutarch, in the time that is
occupied on the small volume of Thucydides.”
