demning some Christians, and having dislodged others from the
stand they had taken upl, was nevertheless greatly troubled
by their very numbers, and then consulted the Emperor Trajan
as to what he should do in future, stating that, apart from the
obstinate refusal to sacrifice, he had found out nothing else
about their mysteries, save ineetings before dawn to sing to
Christ and to2 God, and to establish one common rule of life,
forbiddjng murder, adultery, fraud, treachery and other crimes.
Then Trajan replied that such people were not indeed to be
sought out, but that if they were brought before the court they
ought to be punished. Ο self-contradictory verdict which says
they are not to be sought out, because they are innocent, and
yet orders them to be punished as criminals; which spares while
it rages, which shuts the eye to crime and yet chastises it. Why,
Ο judgment, dost thou cheat thysele If thou condemnest,
why dost thou not also denounce? If thou dost not denounce,
why not also aequit? For the tracking of brigands the soldiers
on outpost duty cast iots throughout all the provinces. Against
those charged with treason and the enemies of the state, every
man is a soldier. The investigation is made wide enough to
take in accomplices and others who are privy to it. The
Christian alone may not be sought out, but he may be brought
into court, as if searching out had any other object than
prosecution! You condemn therefore, when prosecuted, one
whom no one desired to be sought out, one, Ι suppose, who
already deserved punishment, not because he was guilty,
but because, though not to be inquired after, he was found.
Thus not in that matter either do you act towards us
according to the rule for trying malefactors: namely that to
others you apply torture when they deny, to make them con-
fess, to Christians alone you apply it to make them deny. And
yet, if it were a crime (with which we were charged), we indeed
should deny our guilt, but you by tortures would compel us to
confess it. Nor indeed could you think that crimes were not to
be investigated by questionings, on the ground that you were
assured by the confession of the name that they had been com-
mitted. For even to-day, though you know what murder is,
you nevertheless extort from a confessed murderer the whole
train of circumstances touching the act. Wherefore it is with
the greater perverseness that when you make up your minds
beforehand about our crimes from the confession of the name,
you seek to compe] us by tortures to go back from our confession,
with the result that in denying the name we at the same time
