our belief 011 holy words, we raise our hope, we strengthen our
confidence, we clinch the teaching none the less by driving
home precepts. There too are pronounced exhortations, correc-
tions and godly-judgments. For our judgnient too is delivered
with great weight, as among those who are sure that they are
acting under the eye 01 God, and there is the greatest anticipa-
tion 01 the future judgment, 11 any one has so sinned, as to be
banished from the communion 01 prayer and assembly and all
holy fellowship. We are governed by the most approved elders,
who have obtained this office not by purchase, but on testimony ;
101· indeed nothing 01 God is obtainable by money. Even 11
we have a kind 01 treasury, this is not filled up from a sense 01
obligation, as 01 0 hired religion. Each member adds a small
sum once a month, or when he pleases, and only 11 110 13 willing
and able3 101· 110 0110 13 forced, but each contributes of his own
1100 will. These are the deposits as it were made by devotion.
For that sum is disbursed not on banquets nor drinking bouts
nor unwillingly on eating—houses, but on the supporting and
burying 01 the poor, and on boys and girls deprived 01 property
and parents, and on aged servants 01 the house, also on ship-
wrecked persons, and any, who are in the mines or on islands
or in prisons, provided it be 101 the cause 01 God's religion
who thus become pensioners 01 their confession. But the
working 01 that kind 01 love most 01 011 brands us with a mark
01 blame in the eyes 01 301110. ‘See,’ they say, ‘how they love
one another’, 101 they themselves hate one another 3 ‘and how
they are ready to die 101 0110 another'3 101 they will be more
ready to kill one another. But also they rage at us 101 calling
one another brethren, 101 110 other reason, I suppose, than
because among themselves every name indicating blood relation-
ship is assumed from affection. But we are also your brothers,
by right 01 nature, the one mother, although you are little
deserving 01 the name 111011, because you are evil brothers. But
how much more worthily are those both called and considered
brethren who have recognised one Father, namely God, who have
imbibed one spirit 01 1101111033, who from one womb 01 the same
ignorance have quaked before one light 01 truth! But we are
perhaps regarded as less legitimate 101· the reason that no .
tragedy proclaims aloud our brotherliness, or because we are
’ brothers as the result 01 household possessions, which among
you generally break up the relationship 01 brothers. And so
we, who are united in heart and soul, have no hesitation about
sharing a thing. Among us all things are common except wives.
In this matter alone we dissolve partnership, in which alone
all other men practise partnership, who not only use the wives
