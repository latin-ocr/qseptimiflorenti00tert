not spread abroad. J ustly therefore, has rumour and rumour
alone had for so long any knowledge of the crimes of the Chris-
tians. This is the informer you produce against us, one which
as yet has not been able to prove what it Chas so long thrown
out and what 111 80 long a period of time it has strengthened
into a settled opinion. But now to appeal to the credit of

nature herself against those who dare 130 assume that such
stories are to be believed.

CHAP. VIII. Lo, I set before you the reward of such crimes;
they promise everlasting life. Believe it for the moment.
About this I ask whether even you who have believed think
113 worth while to attain it at the price of such a (guilty)
conscience. Come, plunge the sword into an infant whossis
no one’s enemy, guilty of 110 0111110, the child of all: or i·f
such bloodshed 18 another’s duty, do you merely stand by a
human being dying before he has really lived, wait for the flight
of the new life 3 catch the scarce—formed blood ; with it soak your
bread, and enjoy your meal. Meantirne, as you recline, count
the places and mark where your mother, where your sister is;
make a careful note, so that when the dogs have put out the
lights, you may not make a mistake. For you will be guilty
of sin if you fail to commit incest. Thus initiated and sealed,
you live for ever. Please tell me, whether eternity is worth
such a price; if it is not so, it ought not to be believed to be so.
Even if you believed it, I deny that you wished it, even if you
wished 113, Ι deny that you could do it. Why then should others
be capable of doing what you cannot do? why could not you
do it if others can? We, I suppose, are of another nature—
monstrosities with heads of dogs or with feet so large as to shade
us; with teeth differently arranged, and with organs different
from other rnen, for the gratification of incestuous lust! You
who believe such things about a fellow man 0311 3180 do them
yourself. You too are a human being, as the Christian is too.
You who are incapable of the deeds, ought not to believe them
possible. For the Christian also is a human being 38 you are.
But perhaps the ignorant alone are tricked and decoyed into our
religion: for they knew that 110 811011 statement was made
about the Christians : but they must assuredly look to the matter
and study it with all care. And yet, it is the custom, I fancy,
for those who wish to be initiated, first to approach the father
of the rites, and to write down what has to be prepared. Then
he says: ‘You have need of a little child, still soft, with no
knowledge of death, who will smile under your knife; also
