APOLOGETIOVS 35, 36, 37 107

inquire into the safety 01 Caesar, except he who meditates or
desires something against it, or who hopes and waits for some-
thing to follow after? For one does not consult about friends
with the same feeling as about masters. The solicitude of
kinship is of a different nature from that 01 servitude.

CHAP. XXXVI. If this is so, that those are found out to be
enemies who were called Romans, why are we, who are but
thought to be enemies, denied to be Romans? We cannot be
at the same time non-Romans and enemies, since those who were
considered Romans are found 10 be enemies. The fact is that
the loyalty and worship and faith that are due to the emperors
do not consist in services such as even enmity can perform
rather as a cloak to itself, but in those habits. which are as
truly demanded by the godhead as they must be shown
towards mankind in general. For indeed it is not 10 1110
emperors alone that such services of good will are due from us.
No benefit that we accomplish pays any regard to special
individuals, because it is to ourselves that we perform it, and
we do not snatch at payment from a man either 01 praise or
of reward, but from God, who exacts and rewards impartial
kindness. We are the same to the emperors as we are 10 our
neighbours. For we are forbidden to wish evil, to do evil, to
say evil, to think evil, about any one without distinction.
Whatsoever is not permitted against the emperor, neither is
it permitted against any 011ος and what 1s permitted against
no one, is perhaps all the more forbidden against him 11110111
God has made so great.

CHAP. XXXVII. If we are ordered, as we said above, 10
love our enemies, whom have we left to 1101οῖ Likewise, if when
injured we are forbidden to retaliate, lest by our action we should
put ourselves on the level 01 our enemy whom can we injure?
For consider this matter yourselves. How often do you rage
fiercely against the Christians in obedience partly to your
own feelings, partly to the laws'? How often also, passing
you over, does the hostile rabble of its own right 011001( us
with stones and fires? With the very rage of Bacchanals,
they do not spare Christians even when they are dead, nay from
the rest 01 1110 tomb, from the sort 01 refuge that death affords,
they would drag them away, cut them up, tear them to pieces,
when they are already decomposed, when already not even
entire. Yet what instance did you ever note1 of our retaliation
