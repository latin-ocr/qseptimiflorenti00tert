all beasts 01 burden, as well as to asses, heads and bodies both,
along with their own goddess Epona. Perhaps our fault consistis
in the 1661 11161 amongst the worshippers 01 661116 6οᾶ 1166616
01 611 kinds we worship the ass alone.

But he too who thinks that we adore the cross will be our
fellow-worshipper. When some piece 01 wood is propitiated, no
matter for the 16611100 66 long as the quality 01 1116 material is
the same, no matter for the 101111 66 long as the god is bodily
in the image. And yet what a great (1111616066 there is between
the upright 01 6 61066 and the Athenian Pallas or the Egyptian
Ceres, who stand forth 1011111666, 6 rough stake, a shapeless bit
01 wood! Every piece 01 wood that is fixed in the ground in
an erect position is part 01 6 61066; we, perhaps, worship an
unmutilated and complete god. I have said that the sculptors
01 your gods make a beginning with a cross: but you also
worship Victorias, although, in trophies‚ crosses 101111 1116”
inside part. The whole religion 01 1116 Roman camp consists
in worshipping the standards, in swearing by the standards, and
in setting the standards above all the gods. All those rows 01
images on the standards are but as necklaces of crosses; those
pennons on the ensigns and banners are the robes 01 6106666.
Ι commend your scrupulous attitude: you would not dedicate
6106666 11161 were bare and undraped. Others, certainly with
greater semblance 01 0611116 and 01 1111111, believe the sun to
be our god. Ι160, we shall perhaps be classed with the Persians‚
although we do not worship a representation 01 1116 sun on a
11060 610111, 61066 everywhere we have the sun himself within
his own hemisphere. Lastly the suspicion arises 110111 the
knowledge that we turn to the east in prayer. But many 01
you too with an 611661611οο 01 sometimes worshipping heavenly
bodies move your lips towards the rising sun. Likewise 11 we
give rein to joy on Sundays, in a 161 (1111616111 way from 6110
worship, we are only second to those who devote Saturday
(Sabbath) to idleness and feasting, and who also deviate 110111
1116 J ewish custom 01 which they are ignorant. But recently in
this 61157, what is really a new representation 01 0111 god has
been made public, since a certain criminal, hired to trick the
wild beasts, exhibited a picture with an inscription to the
following effect: ‘The Christian God, the Offspring 01 60 Ass.⁷
He had asses’ ears, one 1001 110016(1, was dressed in the toga and
carried a book. We laughed both at the name and the figure.
But they were bound to worship at once a two—formed divinity,
because they have welcomed, as gods, 6166111166 with heads both
01 dog and 01 1100, with the 110106 01 6 goat and a ram, others
’ With goats' bodies from the loins downwards, and like serpents
