know that your very laws also, which seem to tend in the direc-

law as the older pattern. We have spoken already about the
age of Moses. But how little is the authority of -human laws,

against the denunciation of all charges, which clamours for the
blood 01 the Christians. We have shown our whole position,
and in what ways we can prove it to be such as we have shown,
by the trustworthiness‚ 01 course, and the antiquity of our

Who will dare to refute us, not by skill in words, but by the same
method, by which we established our proof, naniely on the ground
01 11111112 But while our truth is displayed to every man, mean—
time unbelief, confounded as it is by the goodness of this sect,
which has now become known to experience, as well as from
intercourse with it, does not of course regard it as a divine

question, but rather as 3 kind of philosophy. Philosophers also,
