vehement supporters. ‘What a fine woman! How merry,
how debonair!' ‘What a fine fellow, what a sport, what a
gallantl' They have become Christians. Thus is the name
applied to their reformation. Some even make a bargain with
this hatred at the cost of their interests, ready to put up with
harm, provided that what they hate is not mixed up with their
home-life. A husband now no longer J'ealous has turned out of
doors his now chaste wife: a father, patient in the past, has
disinherited his now obedient son: a once forgiving master has
banished from his sight a now faithful servant. In each case
the reform effected by the name of Christian is the ground of
offence. Goodness is not of such account as hatred of the
Christians. Now therefore if it is a name that is hated what
charge can there be against a name, what prosecution of words,
unless it be that a particular utterance of a word has a barbarous
or ill-omened or a scurrilous or immodest sound? The name
Christian indeed, so far as its meaning is concerned, is derived
from ‘anointing’ And even when it is wrongly pronounced
‘Chreestian' by you—for neither is there any real knowledge
of the name among you—it is made up from sweetness or kind-
ness. And thus even an innocent name gets hated in the case of
innocent men. But indeed there can be no doubt that the sect
is hated in the name of its Founder. What novelty is there in
a school of thought bringing on its followers a name taken from
its teacher? Are not philosophers named after their founders,
e.g. Platonists‚ Epicureans, Pythagoreans? or even from their
places of meeting and their stations, as Stoics or Academics?
so too physicians from Erasistratus, and grammarians from
Aristarchus, and even cooks from Apicius? And yet the pro-
fession of a name, handed down with the institution from the
founder himself, causes no offence. To be sure, if any one should
prove a sect to be evil, and thus the originator also to be evil,
he will prove the name to be likewise evil, worthy of hatred
from the guilt attaching to the sect and its founder. Hence,
before hating the name, it were fitting first to convict the sect
from the character of the founder, or the founder from the
character of the sect. But, as matters are, though the in-
vestigation and examination of both are neglected, the name is
laid hold of, the name is made the object of attack, and a mere
word prejudges a sect and its founder (though both are equally
unknown) simply because they bear a name, not because they
are convicted of guilt.
