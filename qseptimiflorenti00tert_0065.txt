while you deny the maker. Of course if they had been able to
make themselves gods, they would never have been men,
possessing as they did the command of a higher state. There-
fore, if there is anyone who makes gods, I return to my
examination of the causes for making gods out of men, and
I can find none, unless it be that that great god desired servants
and helpers in discharge of his divine dutieS. But to begin with
it is unworthy of him that he should need the service of anyone,
especially of a dead man, since, if he were likely to need the
service of a dead person, it would have been a worthier course to
have made some god from the first. But I see no room for
such aid either. For the whole body of the world, whether
unborn or unmade, as Pythagoras believed, or born and made,
as Plato believed, was surely found to have been once for all
arranged and equipped and ordered in its present structure
entirely under the guidance of reason. That could not be
imperfect which has perfected all things. Nothing was waiting
for Saturn and Saturn’s race. Men will show themselves 10018
11 they are not convinced that, from the beginning, rains fell
from heaven, stars twinkled, the greater lights have shown their
power, thunders have roared, and Jove himself has feared the
thunderbolts which you place in his hand; moreover every sort
of crop sprang forth in abundance 110111 the soil before the days
of Bacchus and Ceres and Minerva, nay even before that first
man, if there were such, because nothing devised for the pre-
servation and support of man could be introduced later than his
own appearance. Lastly, the gods are said to have discovered,
not to have originated, these necessaries of life. That however
which is discovered, existed, and that which existed will not be
counted as his who discovered it, but as his who originated it;
for it existed before it was found. But if Bacchus is a god
because he pointed out the vine, Lucullus, who first made
cherries from Pontus known to Italy, has been unfairly treated,
in that he was not for that reason deified, as the originator
of a new kind 01 fruit, because he pointed it out. Wherefore,
if the universe has existed from the beginning, both equipped
and furnished with definite plans for carrying out its functions,
this reason for promoting humanity to divinity falls to the
ground, because the positions and powers that you have divided
amongst them existed as much from the beginning, as they
would also have existed, even if you had not appointed these
gods of yours. But you turn to another reason, and reply that
divinity was conferred upon them by way of rewarding their
, deserts. And hence you grant, I suppose, that that god-
making deity excels in justice, since he apportioned 80 great
