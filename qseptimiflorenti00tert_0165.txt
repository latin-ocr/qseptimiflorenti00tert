after to pay it down through an endless eternity. And there-
fore it is neither death at once, nor a recurring resurrection, but
we shall be the same as noxv, nor different afterwards3 wor-
shippers of God indeed and ever with God, clothed upon with
the special nature 01 eternity3 but the profane and those who
are not perfect before God, in the punishment 01 an equally
lasting fire, having from its very nature a supply, divine 01
course, 01 imperishable quality. The philosophers also know
the difference between a secret and a common fire. Thus that
which is 101 human use is far different from that which ministers
to the judgment 01 God, whether it draws down thunderbolts
from heaven, or belches fire 110111 the earth through the
mountain craters; 101 it consumes not what it burns, but
renews even while it destroys. Thus the mountains endure
though always buming, and he who is stricken with fire 11001
heaven is 3310 11010 being reduced to ashes by any other fire.
And this will be a witness 01 eternal fire, this an example 01
everlasting judgment, continually feeding its own punishment:
the mountains are burned and yet endure. What shall we say

CHAP. XLIX. These are the things which in us alone are
called vain assumptions, but in the philosophers and poets are
instances 01 the highest knowledge and 01 extraordinary abili ty.
They are wise, we are 10011311 ; they 310 worthy 01 honour, we
01 ridicule, nay more than that, 01 punishment too. Let the
opinions we hold be 13130 3οᾶ deserving 01 the name 01 prejudice„
but yet they are necessary3 let them be 10011311, but yet they

are advantageous, since those who believe them are constrained
⁷ to become better men, from 1031 01 everlasting punishment and
hope 01 everlasting refreshment. Therefore it is inexpedient
that those things should be called 13130, 01 regarded as 10011311,
which it is expedient should be presumed to be true3 on no
ground whatever ought that to be condemned which is bene-
ficial. It is in you therefore that we find this very prejudice
which condemns the useful. Hence our belief cannot be 10011311,
and, assuredly, even 11 it were 13130 and 10011311, it is nevertheless
injurious to 00 0110, 101 it is like many other things on which
you inflict no penalties, unreal and fictitious things, which are not
prosecuted nor punished, as being harmless; but indeed against
such errors judgment ought to be pronounced, 11 at all, byridicule,
not by swords and fires and crosses and wild—beasts ; in which
unjust cruelty not only this blind rabble exults and insults, but
certain 01 your own selves also, who aim at popularity with the
