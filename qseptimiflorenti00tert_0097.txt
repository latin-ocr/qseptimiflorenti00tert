their partisanship forcibly obtained from Pontius Pilate, who
at that time was governing Syria on behalf 01 the Romans,
Jesus' surrender for crucifixion. He himself also had foretold
that they would do so; a small thing, 11 the prophets had
not also foretold it earlier. And further, on being crucified he
displayed many signs peculiar to that death. For he released
his spirit 01 his own accord with a word, anticipating the duty
01 the executioner. At the same moment daylight was with-
drawn, though the sun was then marking the middle 01 his
course. Those who did not know that this also had been
prophesied1 With regard to Christ, thought that it was an eclipse3
and yet you have that overshadowing 01 the sky recorded in
your secret records. Then the Jews took him down, laid him in
. a tomb, and further surrounded it with a large band 01 soldiers‚
to guard it carefully, lest his disciples might remove the corpse
by stealth, because he had foretold that on the third day he
would rise again 110111 death, and thus escape those who suspected
them. But lo, on the third day there was a sudden earthquake
and the massive stone which had blocked the entrance to the
tomb was rolled back; the guard dispersed in panic, though
no disciples appeared, and nothing was found in the tomb
except the grave clothes. Nevertheless, the rulers, whose
interest it was both to spread a wicked tale and to recall 110111
the saith their tributaries and dependents, spread abroad the

freed from their mistake, and also in order that belief, which is
destined to receive no little reward, should be strengthened by
difficulty. However with certain disciples he lived in Galilee,
a district 01 Judea, 101 forty days, teaching them what they
were to teach. Then, having ordained them to the duty 01
preaching throughout the world, he was taken up to heaven in
a cloud, much more truly than people like Proculus are wont
to assert among you about Romulus. All these things with
reference to Christ, Pilate, who himself also in his own con-
science was now a Christian, reported to the then emperor
Tiberius. But even the emperors would have believed on
Christ, 11 either emperors had not been necessary to the world
or 11 it had been possible 101 Christians too to be emperors.
His disciples also scattered throughout the world in accordance
,with the order 01 their teacher God. They themselves too
having gladly suffered much at the hands 01 persecuting Jews,
01 course 101 their confidence in the truth, at last through the
, cruelty 01 Nero sowed the seed 01 Christian martyrdom at Rome.
