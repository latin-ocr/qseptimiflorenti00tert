xiv INTRODUCTION

listen to guesses about them It is characteristic of the sobriety
of Englishmen, that our scholars, as Lardner, Routh, Kaye‚
Clinton‚ Lightfoot‚ have followed in the modest steps of Tille-
mont, content to collect evidence for the reader’s information,
not without a guiding clue.

A once popular book, of solid but unobtrusive learning, now
forgotten1‚ by an accomplished Cambridge scholar (Biography
of the Early Church. By R. W. Evans. 2nd ed. London 1859.
2 vols. sm. 8vo), if read with the authorities cited in the notes,
will form an excellent introduction to patristic study. Listen to
this character of Tertullian’s apology (Ι 336-8);

Its power is far superior to that of any former defence. Tertullian
not only surpassed his predecessors in information and talent‚ but
was peculiarly fitted by temper to treat such a subject. No one
could express in such forcible language the indignant sense of in-
justice, or represent its detail in a more lively manner. 'N one could
press his arguments so closely, and few had so learned an acquaintance
with heathenism‚ and could expose its follies with more bitter sarcasm
(Apol. 42), or whip its wickedness with a heavier lash (Apol. 35).
The subject too, while it gave free scope to the range of his argu-
mentative powers, neither allured him, nor compelled him to sophis-
tica] subtilties. The free and elastic vigour of a mind that had still
half its strength in reserve pervades the composition3 and if we put
the mere mechanism of style out of the question, and consider the
copiousness, the variety, the interest of the matter, the skilfulness
of selection of topics, and the powerful grasp with which they are
handled, together with the greatness of the occasion, it will not be
too much to say, that it is the noblest oration among all which
antiquity has left us....In what a state of mind do we rise up from
it! Its brilliant pictures are glowing before our eyes, its deep tone
of declamation is sounding in our ears, its imploring, its condemning,
its expostulating accents have touched our feelings to the quick.... y
Heaven and hell have been moved, and have entered into a mortal
struggle, of which we are now enjoying the fruits, in a victory which
has decided the fate of mankind for all eternity. What literary
gew-gaws do the finest orations of Cicero and Demosthenes appear

² Dr Thompson once lamented to me the change of taste for the worse:

“When you wanted to make a present to a young lady, that was the kind of
book to give: but now they take no interest in such things.’'
