word 01 cursing. Plato also did not deny the existence 01
angels: even the magi are ready to bear witness to both names
(1.6. spirits and angels). Nay we learn in sacred literature the
story how, from certain angels polluted 01 their own free-will,
a yet more polluted race 01 spirits arose, condemned by God
along with the founders 01 their stock and along with him whom
we have called the chief. Now it will be enough to explain
the course 01 their work. Their business is the destruction 01
111311; thus did the wickedness 01 spirits begin at the beginning
01 things with a view to the ruin 01 111311. Τ116161016 while it
is true that they inflict on bodies both diseases and some severe
accidents, they also inflict on the soul sudden and strange
aberrations 01 violent madness. Their wonderful subtilty and
fineness 01 texture give them access to both parts 01 111311.
Spiritual agencies have great power, so that being invisible and
intangib'le1 they show themselves rather in their effect than in
their action3 11 fruit, 11 ground—crops are through some secret
fault in the atmosphere nipt in the bud, killed in the seed,

hidden way exhales its pestilentia] draughts. Then by the same
obscure contagion the breathing 01 (1361110115 and 01 angels (upon
us) works corruptions 01 the mind also, in attacks 01 raving
madness and disgraceful paroxysms 01 folly or cruel lusts
attended by various errors, of which the most signal is this by
which it recommends these gods to the enthralled and deluded
minds 01 111611, that it may obtain 101 115611 3150 proper diets 01
11111165 and blood, offered to statues and images. And what
more exquisite pasture could it have than by its deceptive
legerdemain to turn away man from thinking on true divinity?
How it works these very tricks I will explain. Every spirit is
winged. 80 316 angels and daemons. Consequently in a moment
they are everywhere, to them the whole world is one place;
what is being done in any place it is as easy 101 them to know as
to report. Their swiftness is believed to betoken divinity, be-
cause their substance is unknown. Thus they sometimes wish
to be regarded as the authors also 01 what they report; and
they certainly are so at times in the case 01 evil, but never 01
good things. Even the counsels 01 God they in the old days
picked up 110111 the words 01 the prophets, and in these days
they gather them 110111 the lessons 01 Scripture they hear. So it
15 that gleaning from them certain responses with regard to dates
they enviously ape the divinity, while they steal the oracles 01
God. In the sphere 01 0136165, moreover, people like Croesus and
Pyrrhus know with what ingenuity they adapt ambiguities to
