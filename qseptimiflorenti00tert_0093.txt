soil and sky, they wander over the world without either man or
God for their king; they are not allowed even as strangers to
greet the land of their fathers even to the extent of stepping on

⁵ it. While holy voices threatened them with this beforehand, at

the same time all were continually urging, that in the last stages
of time God would then choose for himself from every race,
community and region worshippers much more faithful to whom
to transfer hisfavour, which would be actually fuller by reason
of the capacity of a more developed teaching. He came there-
fore, that being, Christ, the Son of God, who it was foretold
would come from God to reform and illuminate the world.
The Son of God therefore was announced as ruler and master
of this grace and dispensation, the enlightener and the leader
of the human race, not indeed born under such circumstances,
that he should blush at the name of son or at his father's seed;
it was not through incestuous connexion with a sister nor through
the debauching of a daughter or of another’s wife that he got
a god for father, a lover scaly or horned or feathered or changed
into a shower of gold, like Danae's. These shameful deeds of
Jupiter are the gods you worship. But the Son of God has his
mother as the result of no unchastity3 even she, whom he seems
to have (for mother), had not married. But I will first explain
his nature, and thus the character of his birth will be understood.
We have already proclaimed that God constructed this totality
of the universe by word and reason and power. Among your
philosophers also it is a settled belief that Logos, which means
word and reason, is the fashioner of the universe. For Zeno
lays it down that this maker, who fashioned everything in order,
is the same that is called also fate and god and the mind of
Jupiter and the inevitableness of all things. These Cleanthes
combines in the Spirit, which he maintains pervades the
universe. And we also ascribe Spirit as its true essence to
word and reason and likewise to power, by which we have pro-
claimed that God has constructed everything, in which are present
both word when declaring and reason when arranging and power
when accomplishing. We have learnt that this Spirit came
forth from God and by this forth-coming is begotten and has
therefore been called Son of God, and God from unity of
nature.⁸ For Spirit is also God. Also, when a ray is projected
from the sun, it is a part of the whole 3 but the sun will be in
the ray, because the ray belongs to the sun and is not separated
from it by nature but stretches out from it. Spirit comes from
Spirit and God from God as light is kindled from light. The
parent-stem remains whole and unlessened in substance, even
if you borrow a number of offshoots of its character from it:
