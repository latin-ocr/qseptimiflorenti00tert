be unwilling to lose those who are so profitable and so dutiful
to them as you are, if only that they might not be driven away
from you one day by the Christians, if it were in their power
to speak falsely in the presence of a Christian who wished to
prove the truth to you.

CHAP. XXIV. All this confession of theirs, by which they
deny that they are gods and by which they answer that there
is no other God but one, whose servants we are, is sufficient to
refute the charge of signal violation of the Roman religion.
For if there are assuredly no gods, then assuredly there is no
religion either; and if there is no religion, because assuredly
there are no gods either, assuredly neither can we be charged
with violation of religion. On the contrary the reproach has
recoiled on yourselves, who, worshipping a lie, commit the crime
of real irreligion against the truth, not only by neglecting the true
worship of the true God, but by attacking it also Now, even

hands to the sky, another to the altar of Fides3 let one, if such
is your opinion, count the clouds while he prays, another the
panels of the ceiling3 let one dedicate to his God his own life,
another the life of a goat. Beware, too, lest this also should
be combined with the charge of irreligion, the taking away of
the liberty of worship and the forbidding of the choice of a god,
so that Ι should be prevented from worshipping him whom Ι will,
but should be compelled to worship (another) against my will.
No being, not even a man, will desire to be worshipped by an
unwilling person3 and yet even the Egyptians were allowed
