Christian does nothing 01 the kind. No (Christian) 16613 31161116,

one. If he is defamed, he rejoices; 11 116 13 prosecuted, he (1063

11 116 13 condemned, he returns thanks. What evil can there be
in this which has 110116 01 0116 01161600613 01 61711, 6101161 1661,
01 31161116, prevarication, regret, or despair? What? is there evil
in that, which causes pleasure to the person accused 01 10,,
whose prosecution is his dearest wish, and who finds his

since you are proved to know nothing about it.

CHAP. Π. Again, supposing it to be true that we 616Δ
criminals 01 deepest dye, why are we treated differently by
you from our fellows, I mean all other criminals, since the same
guilt ought 00 111660 111011 0116 361116 treatment? When others
are called by whatever name is applied to us, they employ both
their own voices and the services 01 6 paid pleader 00 360 101011
, 011611 111110061106. They have every opportunity 01 answering
and cross-questioning, since it is not even legal that persons
should be condemned entirely undefended and unheard. But
the Christians alone are not permitted to say anything to 01661
themselves 01 0116 charge, to uphold the truth, to prevent 111-
justice in the judge. The one thing looked 101 13 01160 which
is demanded by the popular hatred, the confession 01 0116 1161116,
not the weighing 01 6 charge. Whereas, 11 you were inquiring
into the 0636 01 301116 01111111161, you would not be satisfied to

is followed, although there was an equa] necessity to 3110 by '
investigation the 16136 charges that are bandied about, how
many slaughtered babes each had already tasted, how many
times he had committed incest in the dark, what cooks, what
dogs had been present (on the occasion). Oh what 161116 would
that governor have acquired, 11 116 116(1 1611606(1 0110 301116 0116,

that in our 0636 even such inquiry is forbidden. For Plinius
