that to be a great oath. But demons, that is genii, we have
been accustomed to adjure, 111 order to drive them out of men,
not to swear by them, 111 order to confer the honour of divinity
upon them.

CHAP. XXXIII. But why should I say more about the
religious attitude and the loy alty of the Christians towards the
emperor. 2 We are bound to look up to him as the one whom
our Lord has chosen. I should be justified in saying: the
Caesar is more ours (than youis), as having been appointed by
our God. Accordingly, as he is mine. Ι work more for his safety‚
since I not only ask it from Him who is able to grant it, or
because I who ask it am such an one as deserves to obtain it,
but also because by lowering the greatness of the Caesar as
compared with that of. G0d‚ Ι commend him the more to God,
to whom alone I subject him. But I subject him to Him, to
whom I do not make him equal. For I will not call the emperor
God·‚ whether it is because I am unable to lie, or whether I do
not dare to mock him, or because he himself will not even wish
to be called God. If he be a man, it is man's interest to yield

comes to him from the rear: ‘Look behind you! Remember
that you 3Γο 3 111311 !’ And surely he is all the more carried away
by the thought of his resplendent glory‚ that a reminder of his

vwere then called God, because he would not be truly so called.
He who is recalled to himself lest he should think himself

CHAP. XXXIV. Augustus, the creator of the empire‚
refused even to be called Lord: for this too is a surname of
God. Of course I shall call the emperor lord‚ but with the
usual spelling, and only when I 3111 not forced to call him Lord
with a capital, in place of God. But I am free so far as he is
concerned3 for I have but one Master, the almighty and eternal
God‚ the same who is also his God. How can he who 15 father
of his native city be its lord? Moreover, the name which
suggests affectionate care is more pleasing than that which
suggests authority. Even of a household men are called fathers

. rather than lords. So far is it from being a right of the emperor
to be called God, which is incredible [except] by a flattery that
