towards us, I will now join issue as to the question 011011000000,
and will not only rebut the charges against us, but will even
cause them to recoil on the very men who make them 3 that from

unconscious3 and that they may at the same time blush, while
they accuse us—I do not say the worst accusing the best, but
rather (as they themselves would have it) ordinary persons
accusing their fellows. We will meet each 01 1110 300101 scandals
laid to our charge by appealing to the same acts committed
openly. acts in which we are held to show oursesves wicked,
empty-headed, worthy 01 condemnation and 01 ridicule. But
since when the truth 01 0111 001130 meets you at every turn, the
authority 01 1110 101173 13 01 1031 301 up against it, so that either
it is said that nothing is to be reconsidered 01101 1110 laws have
decided‚ or the necessity 01 obedience is unwillingly preferred to
truth, it is upon the laws that I will first join issue with you7 as
their guardians. In the first place 111011, when you harshly lay
down the law by your phrase ‘Your existence is forbidden,⁷
and enjoin this without any gentler reservation, you make no
secret 01 violence and tyranny as belonging to your stronghold,
11 you deny us the right to exist because such is your will, not
because it was fitting that we should be outlawed. 11 however
you wish this not to be allowed because it is not right, no doubt
an evil action ought not to be allowed3 and 01 0011130 11113 very
1001 involves a previous judgment that a good action islegal.
If Ι shall find something to be good, which your law has 101-
bidden, is it not, by this previous determination, disabled from
forbidding me that which, 11 11 were evil, it would justly forbid?
If your law has made a mistake, I suppose it is because it was
framed by a man, 101 11 certainly did not 1011 from heaven.
Do you wonder either that a man should have made a mistake
in framing a law, or should have come to his senses again when
he finds in it 1001101101 emendation? Did not even the improve-
ments made by the Spartans in the laws 01 Lycurgus himself
cause him such pain that he determined to resign office and
starve himself to death? Do not even you too, as daily ex-
perience throws light upon the darkness 01 antiquity, lop and
cut down all the wild growth 01 11101 ancient forest 01 statutes
with the new axes 01 imperial rescripts and edicts'.l Did not-
Severus, that most determined 01 emperors, as it were but
yesterday‚ abrogate the ridiculous Papian laws, which enforced
the bringing up 01 children before the Julian laws enforced the
contracting 01 marriage‚—laws whose antiquity gave them such
’ high authority? Nay there were even laws authorizing that those
