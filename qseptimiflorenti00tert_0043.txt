grace. By the resort to a public sale of property they preferred
to raise the blush of shame rather than to shed blood. How
many laws still lie hidden for you to purify, laws which neither
antiquity nor the dignity of their framers, but only their fairness
(if such there be) commends? and therefore when they are
recognised to be unfair‚ though condemning‚ they are deservedly
condemned. But how do we call them 11111311ἶί Nay, if they
punish the mere name, we 0311 1110111 10011511 3150. If however
it is deeds that they punish, why, in 0111 0350, (10 they punish
deeds 011 the ground merely of the name, which in other cases
they maintain must be proved by the act and not from the name

forbids the investigation 01 11131 which is prohibited, because

those from whom it looks for obedience. A law excites suspicion

disapproved‚ it claims despotic power.

CHAP. V. And now to treat somewhat more fully 01 1110
origin 01 laws 01 this kind, there was an old decree that no
god should be consecrated by the emperor without the approval
01 the senate. M. Aemilius learnt this in the case 01 1115 god
Alburnus. This, too, makes in our favour, because among you
divinity is weighed out by human caprice. Unless a god shall
have been acceptable to man, he shall not be a god: man must

’ now be propitious to a god. Accordingly Tiberius, in whose

time the Christian name first made its appearance in the world,
laid before the senate tidings from Syria Palaestina which had
revealed to him the truth of the divinity there manifested, and
supported the motion by his own vote 10 begin with. The

Caesar held to his own opinion and threatened danger to the
accusers 01 1110 Christians. Consult your records : you will there
'find that Nero was the first emperor who wreaked his fury in
