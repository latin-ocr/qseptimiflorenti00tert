pottery, and the sacrificial odour from them, and the god him-
self—nowhere to be seen. For at that time the talents of
the Greeks and Etruscans had not yet flooded the capital to
execute commissions 101 statues. Consequently the Romans
were not religious before they w 616 great, and therefore their

I am mistaken, every kingdom or empire is gained by wars and
extended by victories. Again, wars and victories are generally
at the cost of the capture and destruction of cities. That
business cannot be carried out without harm to gods. Walls
and temples 616 involved in common ruin, citizens and priests
are alike slaughtered, and there is no difference in the plundering
of sacred and profane wealth. Therefore the sacrilegious acts
of the Romans 616 65 many in number as their trophies3 they
have triumphed 65 011611 over gods 65 over nations, their spoils
in war are 110 111016 numerous than the images of captive gods
that still remain. They therefore endure to be worshipped
even by their enemies, and they decree an empire without end
to those whose injuries, rather than their acts of worship1, they
should have repaid. But those who are without feeling, it is
as harmless to injure, as it is idle to worship. Certainly it is
beyond belief, that those should have progressed on account 01
their religions merits, who, as we have hinted, have either grown
by injury done to religion or have inflicted injury on religion
by their growth. Even those whose kingdoms have been com-
bined to make up the sum of the Roman Empire, were not with-
out religions at the time when they lost their kingdoms.

CHAP. XXVI. See therefore, whether it is not he who
regulates kingdoms, whose is both the world that is ruled, and
the man himself that rules; whether it is not he that fixed the
alternations of power at their actual dates in the world's history,
who was before all time and made the history of the world the
embodiment of time and seasons3 whether it is not he who
raises or crushes states, under whom the race 01 111611 existed at
one time without states. Why are you led astray? Rome in
her rude state is older than certain of its gods, it ruled before it
raised such a wide circuit as the Capitol. The Babylonians too
had reigned before the pontifis, and the Medes before the
Quindecimvi'ri, and the Egyptians before the Salii, the Assyrians
before the Luperci, the Amazons before the Vestal Virgins.

. Finally, if. it is the religions rites of Rome that confer kingdoms,
