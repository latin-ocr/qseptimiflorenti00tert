has perverted the Old Testament. Certain men from their
stock have by their opinions falsified even this more modern
Testament of ours after the views of philosophers, and from
the one way have caused many oblique and intricate paths to
diverge. I should like to make this remark, lest any one should
think that the notorious variety in our sect should seem to
put us on an equality with the philosophers in this respect
also, and condemn truth out of the variety of defencesl. We,
however, at once lay down to the corrupters of our saith
that the rule of the truth is that which comes from Christ,
passed on through his followers‚ somewhat later than whom
these different commentators will be proved to have existed.
Everything against the truth is built up from the tiuth itself,
this rivalry being due to the spirits of error. By them the
corruptions of this sort of wholesome teaching are instigated,
by these even certain rables have been let loose, such as by
their likeness should weaken belief in the truth or win it rather
for themselves, leading a man to suppose that he must not
believe the Christians for the reason that he must not believe
either poets or philosophers, or should think that he must put
more belief in poets and philosophers because he can put none
in Christians. Thus we are laughed at when we preach that
God will judge. For so do both poets and philosophers place
a tribunal in the world below. And if we were to threaten
a hell, which is a storehouse of secret fire for subterranean
punishment, we are similarly laughed to scorn. For so also
is Pyriphlegethon a river among the dead. And if we were
to name paradise, a place of celestia] delight appointed to
receive the spirits of the saints, separated from the knowledge
of the common world by a sort of wall consisting of that fiery
zone, if so, the Elysian fields have already anticipated the belief.
Whence comes it, I pray you, that these things are so like the
poets or philosophers'? Only from our mysteries 3 if from our
mysteries, then, as being taken from the earlier, ours are more
reliable and more to be believed, whose copies even find credence3
if from their own inventions, our mysteries will then be regarded
as copies of the later, which is not borne out by the plan of
things3 for never does the shadow precede (in time) the body
or the copy the reality.
