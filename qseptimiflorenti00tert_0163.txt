thou shalt come into being. Give, 11 011011 001100, 0 reason
why thou wast created, and then ask how thou wilt come to
be. And yet thou wilt 01 0011100 111010 easily become what
thou at one time wast, because with equal ease thou becamest
what thou wast never at any time. There will be doubt felt,
I believe, about the strength 01 God, who planted (in the void)
this so great body 01 0110 universe 110111 01100 which had never

by the spirit which gives 1110 130 011 001110, 100011 also stamped by
the example 01 1111111011 resurrection 101 evidence to you. Light,

perish 101 ever? Into whatever substance thou shalt have been
resolved, whatsoever material has destroyed thee, swallowed
thee up, 01100οᾶ 01100, wasted thee to nothing, it will give thee
back (to 1110). Nothingness 100011 belongs to him to whom the
whole also belongs. ζΤ110101010,> you say, ‘one must always
