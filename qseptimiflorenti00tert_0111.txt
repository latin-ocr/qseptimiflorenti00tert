birds and beasts, and the condemnation to death of any one
who had killed a god of this sort. Each province also and
city-state has its own god, as Syria has Astartes, as Arabia
Dusares, as the Norici have Belenus, as Africa has Caelestis, ⁰
Mauretania its own chieftains. It is a list of Roman provinces
that I have given, I think, and yet their gods are not Roma,n
because they are not more worshipped at Rome than those who
throughout Italy itself also 310 ranked as gods from municipal
consecration: Deluentinus of Casinum, Visidianus of Narnia,
Ancharia of Asculum, Noitia of Volsinii, Valentia of Ocricu-
lum, Hostia of Sutrium, Juno of the Falisci, who also received
the surname (Curritis) in honour of Father Curis. But we
alone are debarred from a religion of our own. We offend the
Romans and are not considered Romans because we do not
worship the god of the Romans. It is well that there is a God
01 all, to whom willy nilly we all belong. But among you it
is lawful to worship anything except the true God, as if He to
whom we all belong were not rather the God of all.

CHAP. XXV. I think I have now given sufficient proof
about true and false divinity, since I have shown how the proof
holds together, not only by discussions or reasonings, but also
by the evidence 01 those very beings whom you believe to be
gods, so that nothing now needs to be revised for the present
purpose. Since, however, a special reference has been made to
the Roman name, I will not pass over the controversy, provoked
by the prejudiced assertion that the Romans owing to their
scrupulous piety have been raised to such a height 01 glory,
as to have gained dominion over the world, and to have proved
the· existence 01 their gods by the fact that those flourish beyond
all others who beyond all others are mindful 01 their duty to
them. This reward was paid, forsooth, by the Roman gods
in gratitude. The extension 01 the empire was due to
Sterculus and Mutunus and Larentina! For I could not
suppose that foreign gods wished more favour shown to a
foreign race than to their own, and gave the land 01 their
fathers, in which they were born, grew up, were ennobled and
were buried, to those from across the sea. Let Cybele see to it,
if 8110 learned to love the city 01 Rome as the memorial 01 the
Trojan race, her own native race forsooth, which she had
guarded against the arms 01 the Greeks, if she had the fore-
thought to desert to the avengers, w ho, she kneW, would subdue
Greece, the vanquisher of Phrygia. Γ1110101010 even in our time
she has exhibited a signal proof of honour conferred on Rome,
