providence, admired, in consequence of their community of
view (on this subject). Aristaeus also has declared this to you,
So he (Ptolemy) left these records behind, made accessible in
the Greek idiom. To this very day the libraries of Ptolemy
are shown in the Serapeum with the Hebrew literature itself.
But the Jews too read it publicly: this liberty they have on
payment of a tax, and there is common access to them every
Sabbath. He who listens will find God: he also who is at
pains to understand will be compelled to believe also.

CHAP. XIX. The first authority is claimed for these sacred
books by their extreme antiquity. Among you also the claiming
of belief on the score of time amounts to a religion. [Authority
is given to literature by extreme age. For the prophet Moses,
who began from the past his account of the creation of the world
and the growth of the human race and afterwards the power of
the fiood which avenged the unrighteousness of that age, was
the first to proclaim by prophecy down to his own time, and
then through his own exploits, representations of the things to
be, (was the first) also in whom a chronological order arranged
from the beginning has given us a calculation of time. He is
found to be about three hundred years earlier than the date
at which Danaus, the most ancient (hero) known to you, crossed
to Argos, he is found to be about a thousand years earlier than
the Trojan war, which means that he is as much earlier than
Saturn himself. For according to Thallus’ history, in which it
is recorded that Bell, king of the Assyrians, and Saturn, king
of the Titans, fought with Jupiter, it can be shown that Bel
antedated the destruction of Troy by three hundred and twenty-
two years. It was through this Moses also that the Jews
received from God that law peculiar to themselves. After his
time in succession much was recorded by other prophets also
who are older than your records; for even he who prophesied
last either preceded somewhat or was at least contemporaneous
with your philosophers, and even with your lawgivers. For in
the reigns of Cyrus and Darius lived Zechariah, at which time
Thales, the earliest of the natural philosophers, stirred no doubt
by the words of the prophets, could give no definite answer
about the Godhead to the questions of Croesus. To the same
king Solon declamd, in much the same words as the prophets,
that he must look to the end of a long life. So clearly can it
be seen from a backward glance that he (Solon) derived both
your laws and your philosophy from the Jewish law and the
divine teaching. What comes first must of necessity be the
