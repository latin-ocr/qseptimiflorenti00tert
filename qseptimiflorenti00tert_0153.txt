they say, give the same advice and make the 531110 professions,

impunity accmded to our teaching, 11 we are compared with
them in teaching? Or why are they also as our equals not
forced to peiform duties, the non-performance 01 which by us
results in our trial? For who forces a philosopher to sacrifice,
or to swear, or to expose useless lamps at midday? Nay rather,
they both openly demolish your gods and they even blame your
superstitions in their writings, and you praise them 101 it. Very
many 01 them even bark at the emperors, while you submit to
it, and they are more readily rewarded with statues and salaries
than sentenced to the wild-beasts. And deservedly3 for they
are surnamed philosophers not Christians. This name philo-
sophers does not put daemons to flight. Why should it be
otherwise, since philosophers 001151ᾶο1 that daemons come next
after the gods? It 15 3 saying 01 Socrates: ‘If the daemon
permit? He also, when he showed something 01 true wisdom
in denying the gods, yet just at the close 01 1115 1110 ordered
a cock to be sacrificed to Aesculapius, I believe out 01 respect to
his father, because Apollo declared Socrates the wisest 01 men.
Oh ill- advised Apollo! He gave 3 testimonial for wisdom to
that man who denied the existence 01 the gods. With what-
soever vehemence truth 15 hatedl, in that degree does he offend
who sets it forth 35 the result 01 1115 belief-3. he however who

011 this account among the persecutors 01 the truth. Philosophers
affect the truth by mockery and corruption with hostile intent,
and by imitation corrupt it like those who snatch at praise,
Christians both seek after the truth 01 necessity and display
it in its purity, like those who care 101 1311011 own salvation.
So neither in knowledge nor in morality are we on a level, as
you suppose. For what certainty was there in the reply which
Thales, the first 01 natural philosophers, made to Croesus when
he questioned him with regard to divinity, although he had
often employed to no purpose the extension 01 time allowed him
101 deliberationZ But any Christian labourer both finds and
sets forth God and then ascribes to him in deed all that is sought
101111 God, although Plato asserts that the maker 01 the universe
is not easily found and when found is with difficulty explained
to the multitude. Moreover 11 we make our appeal on the
point 01 chastity, I read that a part 01 the Athenian sentence
was pronounced2 against Socrates as a corrupter 01 youth.
