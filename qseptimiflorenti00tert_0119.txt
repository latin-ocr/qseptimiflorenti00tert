APOLOGETICVS 28, 29 95

CHAP. XXVIII. Since however it might easily seem unjust
that free men should be forced against their will to perform
sacrifice (for at other times also a willing mind is enjoined for
the performance of religious duty), it would assuredly be thought
absurd, if any one were conipelled by another to pay respect to
gods, whom he was bound to appease for his own sake without
any urging, lest it might at once be open to him to say by the
right of freedom: ‘I do not want Jupiter to be propitious to
111e3 who are you ’ἲ ” ⁶ Let J anus meet me with angry looks from
any face he likes3 what business have you with ine ’ξ ² You were
framed of course by the same spirits to compel us to sacrifice for
the safety of the emperor, and the necessity for coercion was
as much imposed on you as the obligation of incurring danger
by refusal was imposed on us. We have come then to the
second charge, that of injury done to a more sacred majesty,
since you worship the Caesar with greater dread and more
calculating fear than you do Olympian Jove himself. And
deservedly, if you only knew. For who among the living is
not better than any dead man you like? But even this is not
done by you from reason, so much as from regard to authority
which acts on the spur of the moment3 to such a degree in this
matter also will you be found irreligious towards your gods, in
showing more dread of human power. Finally among you a
man will sooner commit perjury by all the gods than by the
one genius of Caesar.

CHAP. XXIX. F irst then let it be agreed, whether these to
whom sacrifice is offered can confer safety on the emperors or
on any other man, and then charge us with treason, if angels
or daemons, in essence most depraved, work any benefit, if the
lost save, if those that are condemned aequit, if finally, the
dead (such as ye know your gods to be) are guardians of the
living. If SO, they would first at all events guard their own
statues and images and temples, which I believe the soldiers of
the Caesars keep safe by night pickets. I think moreover
that the very materials of these come from the mines of the
Caesars, and that the erection of whole temples depends on
the will of the Caesar. Further, many gods have experienced
the wrath of Caesar. It supports my case, if they have also
found him propitious, when he confers upon them some free
gift or privilege. How then can they, who are in the power of
the Caesar, and who entirely belong to him, have the safety of
the Caesar in their power, so as to appear able to grant that
(safety), which they themselves would more easily gain from
,the Caesar? Therefore it is that we offend against the majesty
