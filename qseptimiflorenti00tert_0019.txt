ashamed that we should set such value on the vituperative filth
which is poured forth upon Aeschines and Antony, political rivals

I believe that 01 111056 who have really grappled with
Tertullian’s difficulties, few will challenge this verdict of a
most competent judge.

I can conceive few more valuable aids to classical scholar-
ship than a digest, not on the plan of the Dutch uariorum
editors, nor yet on the scissors-and-paste plan of Dindorf, of
all that is permanently valuable in commentaries and miscel-
laneous remarks on the Christian apologists, say to 500 A.D.
The work should appear by itself, and would have a permanent
value, whatever manuscripts might spring to light. Critics and
Commentators should be read in order of time and each allowed
credit for his contributions———I would not ruthlessly clip away
even the biographical confidences with which old scholars en-
livened their learning—-; no quotation should be repeated, but
the entire composite note should be fused into unity, references
being reduced to one uniform pattern. Each special subject, as
