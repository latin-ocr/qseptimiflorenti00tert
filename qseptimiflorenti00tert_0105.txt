method only 01 11161161116111. Β111 enough of words; from this
point onward there must be a presentation 01 1116 1111118 116611,
by which we shall show that the nature 01 8οᾶ6 and daemons
is one. Let any one be produced in this very place under your
tribunals, who it is well known is under the influence 01 6
daemon; that spirit, 11 ordered by any Christian to speak, will
as readily 60111666 116611 6 daemon, because it is true, as elsewhere
a god because it is untrue. Let 6011160116 likewise be brought
forward from among those who are thought to be under the
influence 01 6 god, men who by breathing on altars acquire
a divine power from the odour 01 1116 666111166, who 616 cured
by exhaling, and force an utterance as they pant. This very
Maiden 01 1116 Η66176116, the promiser 01 161116, 11116 very Aescu-
lapius, the discoverer 01 611166, 1116 111111161616 01 another day 10
Socordjus, Tenatius and Asclepiodotus, men doomed to die—
unless they 60111666 themselves daemons, not daring to lie to
a Christian, forthwith shed the blood 01 11161 111061 1116016111
Christian! What could be more evident than a 1661 like 111162
what more trustworthy than this demonstrationZ The sim—
plicity 01 1111111 16 101 611 eyes 10 666, 116 own excellence supports
it, suspicion is impossible. Do you say this result comes 110111
1116816 01 601116 deception 01 11161 kind? You will not say it,
(even) 11 your eyes and ears allow you. But what can be 111-
sinuated against that which is set forth in 116 naked simplicity2
11, 011 1116 0116 hand, they are truly gods, why do they say falsely
that they are daemons2 is it that they may please us? 11 60,
111611 your divinity is already subject 10 Christians, and that is
not to be considered divinity which is subject to a man, and
(11 6118111 6611 66101 10 1116 disgrace) to 116 actual 1066. If on the
other hand they are daemons or 6118616, why do they answer
that they play the part 01 8οᾶ6 elsewhere? For, just as those
who are considered gods would have refused to call themselves
daemons, 11 they had been truly gods, 01 6011166 1661 they should
depose themselves 110111 their high dignity, so also these whom
you know 61 01166 10 be daemons‚ would not dare elsewhere to
pose as gods, 11 111066 ,8οᾶ6 whose names they usurp were gods 01
any sort at all, since they would be afraid to misuse those higher
dignities which, without doubt, they would also have to dread.
Therefore this divinity which you hold fast 16 non-existent:
101, 11 11 existed, it would neither be claimed by spirits in con-
fession, nor denied by gods. Since then both sides agree to our
admission, denying that the gods exist, you must recognise that
there is one class only, viz. daemons, but that it is on both sides.
You must now seek 101116611 80(16, 611166 those you had assumed
Α 10 exist, you 166111 616 daemons. But by this same aid 110111 116,
