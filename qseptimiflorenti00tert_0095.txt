so also that which has come forth from God, is God and the
Son 01 God, and both are one. So the Spirit that comes 110111
Spirit and the God that comes 110111 God brought about the
number two, as regards the measure (01 1110 possession 01
being), in grade not in unchangeable condition, and it did
not separate from the source, but came out from it. This
ray, therefore, 01 God, as was always foretold1 in the past,
coming down into a certain virgin and being 101111οᾶ 11110 110311
111 1101 womb, is born man mixed with God. The flesh having
been 111101111οᾶ with breath is nourished, grows up, speaks,
teaches, works, and is Christ. Meantime accept this story,
which is like your own, while'I show how he is proved 10 be
Christ and who they are among you who have previously
supplied hostile tales 01 11101 kind to destroy a truth 01 11113
kind. The Jews 100 knew that Christ was 10 001110, seeing that
it was 10 1110111 11101 1110 prophets used 10 speak. For even now
they are looking 0111 101 1113 arrival, nor is there any greater
cause 01 disagreement between us and 1110111 111011 1110 1001 11101
they do not believe that he has already come. For as two
advents 01 1113 have been indicated, the first, which has already
been fulfilled (in every predicted detail), in the humility 01 1113
1111111011 010011011, the second, which precedes the end 01 1110 world,
in the 1011111033 01 1110 111οΠ11031οᾶ Godhead, they by misunder-
standing the first, have thought the second, which (having been
more clearly prophesied2) they expect, to be the only one. It
was the desert 01 111011 transgression that they should not under-
stand the original advent, 10111 they had understood, they would
have believed, and 11 they had believed they would have attained
safety. They themselves read it thus written, that they have
lost their wisdom and understanding and the use 01 111011 eyes
and ears. It followed therefore that he whom they had assumed
to be merely man because 01 1113 humility, they regarded as a
magician 110111 1113 power, when by a word he cast 0111 demons
110111 111011, restored light to the blind, cleansed the lepers,
braced up the paralytic again, and even by a word restored
the dead to 1110, 1111οᾶ 1110 01011101113 themselves, quelling storms
and walking upon seas, showing that he was the word 01 God
(that is the Logos), that original, first-born word, attended
by power and reason and supported by spirit, the 3011301110
who was both making and had made everything by a word.
At his teaching, however, by which the teachers and leading
men among the Jews were refuted, they were so angered,
especially because a vast crowd was turning aside to him,
